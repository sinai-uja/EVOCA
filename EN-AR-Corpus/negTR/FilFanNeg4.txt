Ghawi faded love I have any hopes pinned to watch a good movie in the first scene in "Ghawi love", and after quite a few minutes I felt a strong sense of calling me to leave the cinema immediately when the remedy the movie! I tried to convince myself when I entered the cinema I Sohahd something different from Mohammed Fouad, based on the views of some, "Unfortunately," who confirmed to me that the film is "cute", but the traditional story about the singer industrious sunken in love with a girl and tries to access the help of his friend, a light shade. However, my hopes scattered completely with the first scene in the film, which we see as a young boy, "Salah" on the balcony of his home exchange glances full of love with its small neighbor, "the king", and exchange message with them in a scolding from his older brother, "Khaled", a sight that struck me Bal_husrp after you watch the film myself with the "good", but I hit the traditional story of naive since Mchdha first. Of course, separated Alhabiban, and travels with her father the king abroad amid the anguish and the tears from her boyfriend Salah under small drops of rain, and then travel to the scene to New Year's Eve and Salah sing one of his songs amid an audience after it became a famous singer. And show a solution Shiha for the first time with the daughter of her aunt Princess Laidi among the public that interacts with the songs Salah, and look at it looks full of admiration, and leaves Salah theater quickly to try to identify them, but graduated quickly from the place, and we discover later that they are the property of Habiba Salah small, without that cares scriptwriter Ahmed Bey trying to show how mites RT King Salah after all these years! Salah and subjected to "leech hot" because of his attempt to defend the King, without a known fact that her character, by the private guard who was appointed by her husband, "Wild", which in turn Khaled El Sawy, which is a big thieves. Despite the humor Ramiz Jalal in general, the weakness of the script and dialogue is not Iattiyah opportunity to show potential, appeared in the most ridiculous scenes of the movie is trying to delivering "Averat" for Zaniness only! It may be the scene only good in the film is when he went out Salah house of his brother Khaled, "Mohammed Mzrban" after trying to arrange his marriage to a girl "caricature," a house, which raised the goodness, to remember the scenes of his childhood and playing with his sweetheart and his friends, accompanied by song expressive songs of Fuad old. Despite the keen scriptwriter to highlight the dedication Salah in his love for its small neighbor, and not to forget this love despite the passage of many years, but that scene recognition belongs to him what she is on Holiday birthday came in very weak in terms of performance analog by Fouad, did not appear to be any impact or surprise he found to his sweetheart after a long separation! Did not respect the director Ahmed Al-Badri minds of viewers when he went Salah to his sweetheart, where she lives when the daughter of her aunt to escape from the hell of her husband, standing under her house in a scene is a duplicate of threatening to rise in case of refusal to go down, inflict a king, and takes Salah in his car and sing her song "Habibi Ya" Explain that it is entirely filmed in the Marina during the day, w m give it back to her home after the end of Cruise and they were wearing other clothes, although it is assumed that they came out in a short stroll! The course teaches ... Betraying his wife with his former lover, tries to exploit this to control it, but that can save her lover, defying the odds and the risks and the owners of large bodies, and succeed in this great success by electric shaver, the film ends with a happy ending, "as usual"! The ceremony "Ghawi love" as much as I've seen in my life as a result of silly scenes and dialogue scenario faq t naivety, and the events are not understood, it was clear that Salah Bey works stretch Lord only at the scene of a single, although the central character in the film, also did not explain to us the mystery show his older brother look man with poor personal front of his wife, in addition to the presence of the daughter of his brother's small, and encouraged her to stick Bhabibha young colleague at the club, which reminded him of the days i Volth ! The primary purpose of cinema is the Interestingness, which will not feel it at all when you watch "Ghawi Love", to the extent that a sigh of moviegoers to the dark fate that make watching this film, saying that "not a scene from Lord of the emotional scenes!"
