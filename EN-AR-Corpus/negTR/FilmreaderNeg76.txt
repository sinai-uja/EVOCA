Movie Name: Tetsuo The Bullet Man with the Super Action Hero is shifting from human to half-human half metal and metal is a firearms filled his body. Not a huge movie, although interesting and perhaps the most successful acceptance away from the competition than if, as is the case here. It is the third film of the same series (the first »Ttsu« Twenty years ago), but for those who did not see the previous films of the series will not find on how much of the film, including the current post earlier. Here a man who witnessed the killing of his son Faiholh anger to a mobile machine for exuberant revenge of the killer and his revealing that his father was behind the incident. Interesting in itself, but it remains limited until the end Favors 0 Rating: 2 / 5
