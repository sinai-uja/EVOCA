Movie Name: Heliopolis under the banner of independent cinema must be what ..... (May 12, 2010) (very bad) Author: Osama El Shazly The genius of the first experiment, the difference in the patent in the mainstream, and this is what to do, "Montier" - and the scriptwriter and director - Ahmed Abdullah completely in his first film, "Heliopolis", this film, which belongs to the so-called Independent Cinema, the cinema, which came to light in search of freedom outside the grip of major production companies. In the Heliopolis was the difference in everything, In the scenario, lighting and editing and sound and sometimes representation, succeeded Ahmed Abdullah and his team in breaking taboos many led by the screenplay, where the film almost no "Story" does not exist to the conflict drama in which, or any point of the peak, as well as the characters superficial totally drawn move on paper, and also remain trapped in the paper during the movie without meaning or purpose makes you feel vulnerable to it. Lighting film miraculous rebel flawed only it does not exist permanently in the internal viewer and does not exist, sometimes in the outdoor scenes - and that one of the differences amazing -, the sound seems to hum in most cases, and the concept and the dialogue was in itself sometimes push the viewer to give up - feature - Audio because it does not make a difference. Amaalogrb is montage, Where the director of business with the experience in the field of editing, and when he made his first film as a director and a thousand story and script tags, he chose the story of four strings dramatic separate is not collected, but the Heliopolis district, it is known that this kind need to be editing a very sensitive and careful to make the viewer does not feel the transition from string to another, But the term of the difference - apparently - was alarming moves sometimes uncomfortable at all times. So here begins and ends with variation of the patent which is adopted by the director in the performance of their representatives and signed everyone in the trap Alastshal except for a few g Khaled Abu Naja, a point light in the film, his performance smooth and convincing, Hanan wrought led personal almost to paint well within the limits of personal amputated dramatic and that the error was not her fault, Hany Adel performance is convincing and try to perform a personal introvert by considering the land, humming to the extent of the disease, easier Lozi still content with her face beautiful only on the screen, The rest of the crew work Vodoa to the extent possible, and that was the insistence of Ahmed Abdullah on the silence of the soldier Mohammed Brekaa - non-logical in many cases his silence - has damaged the line drama of the soldier as a whole and make it a short film within the film did not show such genius, which they declared in those scenes. And remain in the smooth transfer of this independent film strips to the movies to be screened in cinemas under the slogan of independent cinema, as if that sentence must be later. Van was the potential for this film does not allow all of this and we condoned in order to move to another notch on the ladder of independent cinema, it remains to be croaking on the film makers of so many denominations, who lived in the film since its beginning until its end, to the extent that I lose even sympathizing with the experience First sympathy. And finally remains of Heliopolis - the living, not movie - a wonderful living history can not be reduced in a time of foreign and fifties and earlier, and the new millennium in a humiliating reduction of about forty years from the date of the district and Egypt as a whole. Note final: When you make a movie about Heliopolis, please refer to "laugh and play, Seriousness and Love," and Tariq Tlemcani, and "In the Heliopolis Flat" by Mohammed Khan. Rating: 2 / 10
