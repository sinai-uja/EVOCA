Push superficial .. empty .. Plot nonexistent .. Tradition of the series of Heroes .. I did not like the movie followed the flag only to see what made small Negma Dakota Vanng .. Role was bad and almost every scene feel forced to performance .. B oz crew was a bad play roles .. The film speaks about a group of people with supernatural powers that the government is trying to control them and what you want Tsierhm according to their policy ... I would not advise it. My personal assessment: 4 \ 10
