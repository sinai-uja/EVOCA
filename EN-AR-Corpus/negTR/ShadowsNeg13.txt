13- Movie Name: Autumn Sonata 1978 Rating: 2 \ 5 would be the last meeting between Oolmn and Bergman film until after the last two decades. And another one from the work of Bergman Sbaenatip looking for a reason. Film is also a confrontation between a mother and her daughter (the topic touched on in the first Bergman films, "The Dilemma" in 1946). Mother is Ingrid Bergman (no kinship between the American actress and Swedish director) to visit her daughter, a friendly visit turns into confrontation when and family members to open the box and past relationships that bear each and a different button. Oolmn you turn a good film, but overwhelmed is the "Sris" to the workers instead of being genuine forerunner of the director.
