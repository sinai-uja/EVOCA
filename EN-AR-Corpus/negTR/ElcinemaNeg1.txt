Movie Name: Shop Shehata (Ahmad Soud) expected that the film is weak and has occurred, and the unexpected that Khaled Youssef director development and has been this sense has become used to the tools available to him more mature than ever before, for example the camera was in better shape than in all movies Khaled Youssef moves out smoothly and without roughness and strange movements .. True there is provocative scenes such as those which are in the form of photographs, but the total was good, decor was logical and very realistic ...... On the other side you find the volume bar in the very bad to use the music bad, and songs associated with each film to emphasize the message Khaled Youssef political way provocative, as if the idea were not clear even accompanied by songs, the voice of beating a very funny and I can not believe that this sound is still present and using money in the movies it good for the projections Fvo ... These are not projections, but stupidity and ignorance of the language of cinema "If the scene such as a picture of Nasser to crack in the wall is a projection, this summit of ignorance and take the crying Shehata on his father and grabbed a picture Nasser, personal Abdulaziz Makhyoun and the villa and the shop are all projections - and sorry for the word projections - sleep about the shallowness of thought and expression and creativity of poverty, as well as the cinema is not and will not be so Personal Shehata all the goodness that may lead you to describe them naive and Alabt and in turn mischievous brothers the perfect embodiment of the words of evil and hatred, as if the characters are going in one line and did not depart with him to complete the farce of killing Shehata then and what's more forgiveness for his brothers and in turn back his two brothers to their senses. .... Ya Salam-Hashr ... I did not feel in my life such a quantity of lectures, issues and topics being discussed in about two hours and a half hours once, everything, everything that comes to mind you'll find in this film: politics, education, groups, bullying, slums, corruption All levels are clowning this?? Remember me Tatars the beginning of 2013 to 1981, which you'll find everything It Bit dispersion of the director and the author and the desire to crammed everything so that w Aiqa to express about the state of the country in bakacad Lat yen in the last, and was not satisfied with that, but jumped to the near future to provide the end by moving it in the viewer directly and provocative and unilateral stance to the extent large and if the film is a talk show to view and views frankly and directly with more and more screaming and wailing Representation, certainly have been brought in Haifa, for reasons purely commercial and not there is any suspicion of art in its choice, Valtjsid Quarter of the word "rubbish" so it was Haifa, and I mean the representation and not the format, expressions of non-existent, sound bad and not good speech, clothes and spare accessories only to increase dose of excitement, expression Conquer zero Amr Saad: I can not believe that there is the description of his performance in the performance of Ahmad Zaki escape ... How can this, his performance was normal that he entered prison, especially in the scene where he stood silent in front of Haifa was excellent, and after his release from prison find sophisticated about what happened at his performance, but to be described Ahmed Zaki in the escape was quite far away from that description Amr Abdul Jalil and repeated provocative of his character, while soft and provocation comes from trying to inject some personal changes in order to say it's different, such as heart, "c" "d" but is is the same character and the same performance Mohammad Karim: It is better for him to stop acting but he could not be fluent in any scene of him on and what Astvzny much is the performance of motor was in extremely bad, especially in the watch with Haifa, which was hit by was the gesture funny and not in line with the position fully to confirm the theory in that he has no talent for film Managed to escape from all this, Ik is "Mahmoud Hamida," which was able to provide an integrated personal performance integrated defect was not tainted by the best in this film at all Rating: 3 / 10
