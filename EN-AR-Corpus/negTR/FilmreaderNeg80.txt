Movie Name: South of the Border third movie to Oliver Stone about the leaders and heads of state after his film about the late Yasser Arafat and his film about Cuban President Fidel Castro. Here came the role of Hugo Chavez, Venezuelan president who talks about the thorny relationship between him and the United States. Sixtieth of the three films are about the leaders of American politics are tough but this is the most integrated, although it does not contain an integrated search on the subject, but a selection of interviews with the director and a number of Latin American presidents who cast themselves on the subject. Despite its limitations in creating a unit in any direction, whether the trend in favor of U.S. policy or the policy of Chavez, but that the film is the best achievement of my film director ex-mentioned, it is best made of feature film about former U.S. President George W. Bush 0 Rating: 2 / 5
