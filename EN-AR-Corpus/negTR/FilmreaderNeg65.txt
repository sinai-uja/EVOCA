Movie Name: Rocky V | John G. Avildsen after five years shows Rocky again. I beat the Russian in the film before, but the price was terrible: I have injured his head strikes a harsh affected Rjaanh and mental abilities (though to some extent), which returned to New York and lost his property and his fortune and declared bankruptcy and now trains boxers young but this boxer does not work and leave and go to the others. His young son (played by his son and the real Sage Stallone, who later emerged that in a few movies) and grouchy most of the time doomed into tears at the ruins of the previous films. But there is another fool who wishes to challenge Rocky accepts the challenge because he wants to challenge himself. In this film back Ofeldsn to output, such as a doctor, but he tries to re dead to life Rating: 2 / 5
