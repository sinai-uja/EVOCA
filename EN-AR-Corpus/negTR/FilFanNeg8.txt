Heliopolis I want to explain that the first film, "Heliopolis" the quality of digital movies that avoid mass production, but depends mainly on the weak production, which lacks all kinds of modern technology. The beginning I do not know what to say about this film, which caused Birhaki view it hard, and I experienced a state of boredom with the course of events is interesting, either socially or physically or ambiguous, or any kind of movies that are known to the Egyptian audience. But in the beginning of the film with the appearance of singer Hany Adel in the first scene inside the French embassy, while trying to complete the procedures traveling to France, I expected that the film will carry about the significance of foreign travel and other youth problems. Suddenly, without any introductions shows a soldiers security installations in the booth its own did not utter a single word throughout the film, the events continue in the presentation of Story Hany Adel, military, and The intending spouses and running the hotel Hanan wrought separately, do not link any of them the other relationship, but the only link between them is the place "Heliopolis". By the middle of the film turned the film into a documentary talking about the difference between Heliopolis as a "Akhawajat" and our time is this, and the photographer is Khaled Abu Naja, not deduce any political aspect in the film only emotional relationship between dog hobo and military, where the dog was eating when eat military. For a moment I was struck by the performance of Some artists in the film despite the fact that most of them are former first for them in Altmt Yale, and on top of stretch, Lord Hany Adel and actress Yusra Lozi, Muhammad Brekaa who made the role of the military, and the artist who made the role of line Iba you are looking for an apartment with a line Ebha, actress Hanan stretch Careful, and for the output did not think that Ahmed Abdullah made any kind of creativity in the output and this depends on the Noor Aziz, seen from the factors. Of those factors of production is very weak, and its provisions, which depicts the place where it was adopted in most Kadrath to portray places and buildings of architectural style, which impressed upon date "Akhawajat" in Heliopolis. Arrived in my case in the penultimate stage in the film to a state of ennui, and not apprehending the basic objective of the film and began to squeeze my brain to connect with the thought of the author and director Ahmed Abdullah, who Astt makers that makes me feel dizzy and fatigue of thick Rh thinking, so I decided at that time that content with the result that I reached it, the success of the director in the i Song of the suggested place "Heliopolis" and the relationship of the film's characters is interdependent e place. Finally, I think the experience in itself open the way for the production of films with the production of weak, but its success depends on the scenario, dialogue and story, which lost her "Heliopolis" to a large extent, using some of the techniques is in charge can exit to reach a high degree of success.
