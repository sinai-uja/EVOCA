Me or my aunt from the usual talk at the outset for a way out of work and the effort made with Almmt Lin and elements of the work between his hands, but the situation here is very special case, we are in our hands the film for "Mohamed Heneidy," briefly before us represented for does not require the director film any effort, and I do not mean literal Almmt for high performance and high emotions in the extent that It Supplies to the director leaves him the freedom to do its part as he sees it, but I mean that the roles of "Heneidi" Taatt not only the core of it, "Ivtkas" some "Alivihat" fast-ridiculous, and that will not Taatt the core of the director of any guidance or guidance. I did not feel that "Ivihat" Heneidi different or new from the previous films, to feel that "inventory" Ivihath about to end , But to be said the whole truth, there are Ivihat new, but I "Imtedt," including some of the thing, for Almt two thousandth the scene trying to "Timor" to persuade the quorum "Bashandi" as the Arabic w ri "rider" puck, and start trick involving his two friends "AMR" and "Fuda" With some video that Almwt Rat Imp out of the body of our friend, we find the smoke came out from behind the Heneidi, who says "I became the work of Pepe smoke!" , Or when you enter the "aunt Nosa" Timor was originally a women's prison and are in serious need to go to the bathroom and is being conducted behind prison guard, meeting the call of nature as do the men are certainly Timor, but I found the scene is funny as far as I've become sick! For his effort in the performance of "aunt Nosa" it is clear that considerable effort has already wear it with the "blocks" flesh, which is twice its original size. On the other hand was the director Saeed Hamid, "Kitt saw trick" in this film, because of the money supply made available by the use of high technologies "Almwt Rat invisible" in line with the world of the jinn and "Hocus Pocus" , But "striking" Here is a team work, "young people", especially director of photography, "Mohammed Shafiq," which is this is his fourth, and Almuinterp "Nesrin Fahim" in her first, and who nevertheless was chosen for two successful, and left the film in "i Revp" and fast rhythm. Idea of shared movie interesting, and helped the scenario writer Ahmed Abdullah to display what the forms of fraud that occur on those who believe things hypocrisy a high level and convincing Almwirat visual that have used Hamid However, the resolution of this issue it was possible to take the space faq t than a minute that occur The "Timor" on "backwardness" that characterizes all of these incredibly Turahat, and that we must be "death" and return to our religion .. Etc., but they were satisfied with the simple solution presented in this sentence! Crown comment on the songs of the film, Valognep first name with 50 girls in her words "possible" reason and accept the existence and subject matter, the utensils that bakacad song sang by Nosa aunt in the women's prison When offered the "father of East Timor" Marriage is named "Hijosoni my father" about it is one of the silliest songs you might see in the movie, was not seen Tot endearing to the public also has Ath Wirt's comments and then it's "eh Habal de" or "er Alabt who Bicoloa de ", and thus were not important or relevant Tot see positive, but what happened was the opposite. For Yale represented the "minimum Ghanem" had affected Disposed of before that have a presence on the screen through participation in the series presented in the month of Ramadan, it also has a strong voice and a warm can exploit its presence later in the film is grainy, and the new face that has the role of "Fuda" a talent and a clear expression to his face, The future bodes well for him to check in the selection of roles after that, and Ala Mursi was trying desperately to express its presence through the "Ofshat" comedies simple e did not find for itself a place next to "Heneidi", and we have Hassan Hosni "spiritual father" to all the young stars or "Amulet Lucky" youth movies, which Ath-bit and still Itbt That "the thousand faces", but the fear of becoming a "paper burned" with the permanent presence to the public, the artist Fadia Abdul Ghani has Omtatni the performance of their role bushy Lira. The soundtrack for Moody Imam were not in force and strong and "wonderful" as it used to this artist. Film in general is one of the summer movies that succeed with the public, which is the primary objective of It Laq some Alivihat ridiculous that Srddha Alot Fall and young people, but from another perspective, we find that movies comedy star in the fifties, "Ismail Yassin," which is similar to content in Ronevi beard with films of this period, and despite the fact that at the time the fifties were exposed these films to attack only Now it is one of the "treasures" of Egyptian cinema! , Will there come a day in which we find the films "Heneidi" has become the treasures is the other?!.
