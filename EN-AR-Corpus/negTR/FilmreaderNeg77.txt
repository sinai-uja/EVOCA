Movie Name: Alduahon three women living in an annexe to an old palace are the secret of a large buried in his garden. Raja Amari's second film an interesting cinematic experiment. Where a few scenes and holds a prominent Ojawaoua untapped thriller for myself. The problem is that writing does not expand as a sponsor offering more of the concerns and keep the matter is committed to the line main: Hfaisp Herzi (gained fame in the movie »couscous fish« or »secret couscous«) is a younger full of desires, emotional and sexual and are ready to revolt because they do not understand why it and her sister (Sondos Belhassen) and their mother (and the way Darry) isolation from the world. Discover the reason and others in the end, but ironically that lead to squeezed Hacra instead to live throughout the scenes prior as is the case when the movie a mystery wants to resolve it does not work create the puzzle and put the answer in scenes rapidly, and not enough to donate the viewer to question and then goes with him before returning him. The end of a remarkable scene and see where Aisha (Herzi) walk was freed from the inhibitions on the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, a white robe stained with blood. Liberated in the context lost her mind 0 Rating: 2 / 5
