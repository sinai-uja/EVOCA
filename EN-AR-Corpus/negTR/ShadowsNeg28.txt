28 - Movie Name: Precious Rating: 2.5 \ 5 a tragic drama about the girl at the age of sixteen years (Gpaore Sidibe) pregnant from her father, and suffering from ill-treatment of all. He is also about trying to help restore confidence and it is an opportunity exploited by Precious (also named) to move from the world of dark and painful to the last hope for a better tomorrow. All that good but the film as an humanitarian imposes on the viewer of this letter and makes it difficult to force them 0 possibilities: non-existent.
