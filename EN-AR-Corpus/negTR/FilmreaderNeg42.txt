Movie Name: The Little Drummer Girl conflict intelligence by "Munich" - Spielberg Director: George Roy Is 0 the roles of the first: Diane Keaton, Yorgo Vujagis, Klaus Kinski espionage [Palestine / quotes literary] | United States --1,985 novel John le Carey "Girl Drum small "and one of the few accounts of the film transfer of the writer. Before that The Spy Who Came in From the Cold transformed: the spy who came from the cold The Looking Glass War in 1967 and then "telescope war" 0 And "Little Girl Drum" published in 1983 and abducted by Warner and then chose the successful director George Roy is to be implemented and this was his thirteenth note that he did not come out only fourteen films. That his other films were successful, enough that his films with Robert Redford and Paul Newman Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Cod and The Sting Sting First in 1969 and the second in 1973. Their film, which I think are best achieved by a Slaughterhouse-Five and I have not seen that movie, but twice, most recently in 1982 after ten years of production 0 novels if Carey is not like the stories of Ian Fleming innovator James Bond, and his heroes are not like the 007 as well as the adventures are not the same. In the work if Carey skill and style of literature and wanted to move carefully suspense drama storyteller. The novel "Girl T, but small" and one of his best work but the film is not one of the best movies do, unfortunately, part of the reason for the great back to that if Carrie looked at the Arab-Israeli conflict in those years played the two sides Hroppema in Europe look at the careful, which has something to say in a struggle to find that all the i Rack which has the argument that the other face of that violence was not a recipe Filst Inyin and the Arabs alone, but of the attributes of the Mossad as well. If Carrie did not try to justify the cruelty of the Israelis and the Palestinians and give point of view. But that was not the George Roy Hill, he was working in Hollywood, which was probably left in everything except the subject of Arab-Israeli conflict, and is linked to the mentality does not want to wake her from sleep 0 Heroine of the film is Charlie (Diane Keaton) are representative of the American Theatre in London, is exploited by the Mossad to the rhythm of mysterious and difficult man named Khalil (Sami Frey) is headed by a terrorist group planted bombs in the homes of Israeli diplomats in the lecture halls frequented by men no. Charlie fall in love with an Israeli officer named Joseph (Yorgo Vujagis), but this is implemented as it deems fit for his country according to the orders of a superior Kurtz (Klaus Kinski), and the packers to exploit it to the last. As a result of that relationship agree that the claims revolutionary based on their knowledge of the former's brother President of the Palestinian group, carrying her bag and landing in Beirut (the imaging between Germany and Greece, with scenes set out in Lebanon) where training in a Palestinian refugee camp and in the process of execution in the Israeli spy had entered Lebanon to pursue stages of its work. While returning to Europe are related to the group and prepare them to meet with Khalil. Mossad plans to be a critical meeting and stormed the stronghold Khalil after the arrival of Charlie and kill 0 My problem with the film begins Bdayan ketone, which was contacted Palmkrj and asked him to transfer personal represented by the British to the U.S. (which means it is they do not want to be represented with a British accent would not be good at anyway because if mastery of what made the request) compared to do without half of her wages who had arrived in time to two million dollars. The result is disastrous on the screen. Diane does not have an independent idea of what to wear inside during fathom the events therefore content themselves with the representation of complex emotional moment as they are received in the scenario. They reflect the personality of naive agree that through Israel the right to defend itself and protect its existence, but opposed to this method of defense. In the novel, the British actress left clearly and graduated from training in Palestinian camps is more belief in the Palestinian cause, but her love for Joseph Israel and the pressure by Khalil to perform a terrorist push it to a nervous breakdown at the time that will not stop the head of the Mossad using it to reach its objectives ( Khalil was killed), regardless of the cost 0 Transferred to the woman I want him naive answer to the question about why the deal this dual role, and why have the political emotions towards the Palestinians. Movie cloud the political torch In contrast to portray the heroine it blindly do not know yet what to do in order to grant the justification you need personal 0 In the film mention of the massacre at Deir Yassin, scene of a Palestinian leader (one-eyed League of black eye) talking about how to divide the Palestinians between the Jewish and Zionist, but the amount a little to impact true Vbatolp actual is for men the Israeli intelligence who have to violence in defense of their threatened Output to no depth in it, and representation, not far from square one by everybody, but while the rest of the representatives are lying behind what is expected of their personalities (on both sides of the political line), the ketone, which had a pregnancy film, straining to find a convenient, but it always seems less satisfying what is required 0 Rating: 2.5 / 5
