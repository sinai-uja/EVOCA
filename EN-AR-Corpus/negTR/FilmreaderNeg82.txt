Name the movie: Transformers 2 will be destroyed when Al-Ahram? I wondered why the obsession with the destruction of Al-Ahram in a few films during the last ten years. Al-Ahram, or other Pharaonic monuments, or the popular markets. What about Paris in the film, Mr. Summers? In the context of heroic soldiers try to save Paris from the bad guys who want to destroy, destroying half of what triggers the question what if they did not intervene perhaps the damage was less. But this film has to walk and I am as well. Came out of it and entered the film intelligent features because the author still has some good craft and the desire to exercise as much as 0 from the cinema strange these days. Is not it? One of the main elements of suspense movies is that there will be interesting. This critic of those who find that this element is missing in half the film and is located on a weak part in half the other movies. Movie Rating: 1 / 5
