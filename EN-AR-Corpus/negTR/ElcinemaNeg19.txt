Movie Name: wedding ceremony with premeditated theft ........ (July 16, 2010) (stigma) Author: Mohammed Rifai film, unfortunately, stolen from the film famous American name "things very bad" or "very bad things" produced in 1998 with the vast difference ... "wedding" movie pale without taste. Representation is very weak and the unfolding events is logical to get on the end makes us wonder, "is a movie want de uh?". American film of the type of black comedy, so the idea of killing repeated in the film she is receptive, but it was also a comedy with a special character. I was wondering about the participation of Mohamed Riad and Iyad Nassar in this work. For Ewan, I advise him to Blaptaad representation because his presence in the film was non-existent. Now my question to those in charge of this work, When you steal the American movie Tsourtm we do not watch foreign films or do not remember what we have seen them? Or we do not compare the movies? If you compare the comparison will be favorable to you? Advice from me, respected, even if the mentality of the viewer onion!!! Rating: 1 / 10
