Overall the film, released today - the proposal - which is that this film revolves around a proposal presenting the Chief of Police Stanley Charlie Barnes to go and bring his brother the rapist and the victim to be tried in order to return him and save his younger brother Mickey Barnes of death .. A simple story and screenplay as well as very simple .. Overall performance was average and the average film also .. The style of the director is either adored or despised .. My personal assessment: 4 \ 10
