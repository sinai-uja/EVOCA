Movie Name: Bobby Ahmed Hussein, when I heard about the film Bobby at first .. I learned that the film discusses the current Alozmpaliguetsadipalaalmip, and it is a film of the leader Adel Imam. Predicted that it would be a giant movie and probably will be the best movie this year. But, unfortunately, was shocked Andmachahdt film. Jaddamn weak film Where output (in what he was thinking director Wael Ihsan, came the viewer Mmlpjadda lost with suspense, and arrangement drama suffers from a clear imbalance, involving the soundtracks in some of the scenes non-moving), but the script and story do not overlook the political dimension for classes of society different, but Knhajaet superficially incredible ..! Baliiverat full of sexual lost Toterhama repetition. The representation, there is no new. I hope that the duo just in front of the Railway and Joseph Iawwadonavi their films to come. Rating: 2 / 10
