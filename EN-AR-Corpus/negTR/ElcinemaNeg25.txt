Name of the movie: Another World Author: Dr. Ahmed Shawki has. Mohamed Refaat screenwriter, a long queue of critics who see sinned when he decided to write to the cinema .. I have the opposite view is that one of the best writers of dialogue in Egypt Voflamh always characterized by a refined and interesting dialogue between characters And that was severely lacking for the literal script writing .. maybe he needs to participate in his films with an experienced writer .. .. just the opinion of the film is not very bad that I sought him, from the writings of cash .. away from the quarter last hour (disastrous) film is a widely accepted evaluation : 4 / 10
