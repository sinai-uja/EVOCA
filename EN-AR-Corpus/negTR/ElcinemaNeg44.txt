Name of the movie: without control Author: Mustafa Murad after watching the film without censorship has become in a state of shock for a period of minutes and is due to how the four people sat down to write the screenplay for the film with this level of decline And how representative of the talented, such as on behalf of the tan that injects himself in a movie like this and when made to us Hani Girgis Fawzi film has specifications good or even acceptable, and why Ahmed Fahmy interject himself in the area to get used to see where many of the questions revolved in my mind but have not continued to convincing justification . Came the events of the movie boring and flap because of its similarity and repetition of the scenes at frequent intervals and introduce you to after the events that I saw and Azhaltny to join me in a stuporous story revolves around "Ahmed Fahmy," a handsome young Rewish and his father, who died and left him money i Accountability is addicted to alcohol, drugs, and loves to have sex with the girls, but falls in love with a girl still in school and another character in the film, which the artist "Ola" girl homosexual practiced "lesbianism" with the owners of girls and proud to be an abnormal m and the film and another young religious, but it is sitting with Hwlala T Huelva to explain to them the lessons and lectures, and two other young men from families of average E and a poor always soaked in addiction and combines all of these figures is the presence in the apartment, "177", which does not Altimp never finish them after the emergence of film times a vacuum. If we talk about the script and story do not exist on the importance of Archaeological Nin in this film clich√© because it did not provide a new and I think due to the producer is Hani Girgis Fawzi, who used always to produce these films but the only difference this time he is the director of the film and the failure of four "Fantastic" i Lab Film Institute to write the scenario addresses the issue of one Duck leaflet is correct at the girl's case and the only gay film-makers that the ducks He may receive the looks and expressions just silly and the songs in the film, there is no significance because Rabin does not have a good stretch in the film originally. The output came marginalized and vulnerable Hons first because the director is not able to control the tools and Adotp not even representatives and was naive No Qusay border in a scene burn the academy, and assured us Hani Girgis Fawzi in the first experiments Alakharajip he does not understand the meaning of art and its entry into the world of cinema was from my point of view is wrong. The Altmt Yale was bad for the maximum limits The performance of And rhythm Ahmed Fahmy duck Leah and unconvincing in all movie scenes, and relied on his charm and appeal which has become the criteria is not sufficient to make a star box and either Maria, there is no justification for their presence in the film because it does not have only movements of comics that you do always in Kleptha and manufactured is and Fahmy duet wonderful in the fall of the rhythm the film and its failure, and Alaa Ghanem Kdmich_khasip girl homosexual duck Leaflet pale and very weak, and despite the presence of filled in the art scene for several years but did not Tstt p be a duck him for a good movie and then for most of her generation of artists and Dolly Shahin of the film to another Deuteronomy bit of all that is able to be an artist sense of the word and you need Lkt to see the exercises in Altmt Yale In mastering the Egyptian dialect, which did not you speak after and it was Edward in "a new addition to the roles of bad," which does not tire is provided in most of his movies, and Nabil Issa Almmt's supposed always to the public in movies Hani Girgis Fawzi, but what saddens and amazes me in the film is that one Abott Machine Alsazgen star as tan who introduced himself with people who do not always think only in sophistication in the torture, why then represented by a genius for tan agrees on behalf of a presence in the film at this level?? As Hassan Hosni, please Aljdoay Nana supposed to be adults, this film, but they became the youngest of children are either Randa Bheiri side Alamadiye "Only" in this farce film. But for how long this kind of films that talk about the reality of young people that are not corrupt, tired of Alktherin presented as if they were opened Acre Which experience has shown that this kind of films we could not well implemented in the recent period, which was considered unsuccessful attempts to mimic the film immortal in our minds "we are students," directed by genius "Atef Salem," and I hope one day the rest of the films Silly laugh, which omitted the creators themselves do not respect our minds, but what worries me is that the industry failed in Asda recently became a film Lee has more money, not the art. Rating: 4 / 10
