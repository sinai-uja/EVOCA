Movie Name: Hulk wrote: Slumdog Starring: Eric Bana, Jennifer Connelly, Nick Nolte Director: Ang Lee on the personality of comics that created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby for Marvel's work will come to film the ninth director Taiwanese Big Ang Lee, a research project a secret for the University of California carried out by Professor Bruce Banner and his colleague Betty Ross, While his opponent's stubborn Glenn Talbot keeps his eyes and ears of the vigilant control of the key new scientific and tighten his grip on the research lab, but things are swell when exposed to sunlight pilot Bruce did a special type of cells present in the body is already turning him into a giant green angry, Things evolve and then the emergence of worker hygiene in the laboratory and the suspect, who is the application of such radiation on experimental animals of different turning it into monsters launched on the Elimination of Betty Ross to prevent impact on Bruce and especially as the daughter of General in charge of scientific research for the U.S. Army's secret .. I do not know really what you pay Ang Lee to pass from the resounding success in 2000 when he presented the most successful film in the history of Asian cinema a dead tiger, a dragon hiding to re-submit this story comics that have successfully serializes A television famous when presented in Sbieinat, is it the kind of love adventure? Or change? Or challenge? I did not find a clear answer to this question .. This short film is a bad film, Khaltunai sense since this editorial, Ttrut film in the foreground may want Ang Lee to give a sense of where you see the photo story, but this feeling be wrong, and instead lost by the early optimistic and feel that the less professional than I had hoped, but the real disaster is not lies here, Ang Lee maintained an approach a strange story in the novel, using tricks and flash Montegep give you a sense in many aspects of the work that you see the serial Tlvizionea and not a movie, Furthermore, this method confusing the viewer loses focus immediately, the film does not enter into force soon because of the lack in depth and stay on the surface to become very badly, losing an important part was probably able to compensate for lack of text, and I mean the thrill, Intrusive used here by multiple cameras, games Montegep and the large number of objects in the scene one gave the viewer a kind of tranquility and is watching events because of the involuntary feeling to the viewer the existence of a third party between him and representatives is the director, is partial and tranquility do not need the viewer never in the quality of such acts, That comes to a stronger stages of the movie in two scenes I negotiate when David Banner, Betty Ross about his extradition to her father in exchange for permission to see his son for the last time, a sight that the lack of Mntkith appear together in these events because it lacks the games Montegep exerted by Ang Lee lavishly in this film, And the second is the height of Action scenes that haunts the Green Giant by the army in the desert, scene of his power stems also his return to the method of film away from the TV shows that have killed other Action scenes in the film. And not beyond that, I do not know what you linking this movie with Arabic music, which filled and overflowing its environs, is it the kind of experimentation? Or renewal, or make a stranger to draw attention? In addition, the particles that are supposed to be based upon intellectual depth of this work confused and lost, the amount of contrast filling the entity to Chksite Bruce Banner, the relationship between the beautiful and the Beast, The madness that can affect Bruce between the love of power owned by and between the quest for salvation of them, the memory is credited to Bruce, which refuses to remember the past, and Alaqtin is Ahumaimetin between parents and children, all of these particles over the text unnoticed, although it was possible for him to intensify some of them recouping all the shortcomings of the suffering. Above all, come the end of the film and the screenwriter, as if unable to find the best ones, when they can not all the weapons on the elimination of the giant green, before it disappears and appears again in Latin America, the conclusion does not serve anything in the film and the events, only a small hope looms the producers to submit a second part of it, Which did not occur until a new version of the film is much better cooked by Louis Itrier in 2008. Eric PANA performances and Jennifer Connelly is very faint, although Ijthadahma, and the fact that the characters are written to the need for more than just good performances, especially that we are talking about a film Super Hero, this kind of work comes to the performances based on other molecules of the film, Not based on the film by the molecules, in turn provides Nick Nolte very emotional performance, perhaps it may seem appropriate from the point of view as long as is customary to provide the sinister characters in the comics way emotionally charged, but this also does not achieve the goals only here. Even when you're aware that this is not one of the best films of Ang Lee, and even perhaps the least of the level you are insisting on a view, a conviction I have that guy is way out of the caliber, but even that perception faded I have now, despite the survival of my conviction as it is, this film is definitely the worst movies Ang Lee and the only real Tumble in his career.
