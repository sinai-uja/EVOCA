Name of the movie: Mahien versa Khalid Saleem rushes the viewer to follow up a movie for entertainment, or an idea, but here, no idea nor entertaining, just screwed to the performance of a group of youths between them and the representation between Earth and Saturn .. Not something pulled me in the film at all. This level of performance Altsthristi Idiot. The story, the theme addressed by Unemployment Egyptian cinema so much, I have nothing wrong to be taken up again and again, but another angle and a new way, but this method Almmjoj, it is obsolete. Overall, this experience helps me more and more away from the fight in Cinema View Post new generation who saw them in this work which is called the film transcended. Rating: 1 / 10
