Movie Name: Please Call Me Back Bulbs, the latest movies ..... (January 20, 2010) (Poor) Author: Osama El Shazly Do not drink the drug, which sent your daughter in the request, it marked a killer movie, I mean medicine There were those famous phrase that came to the San Gmadar capital in the film wonderful Emad Hamdy throughout watching the movie "Call Me", especially after the statements both from the author and producer of the film, which hit me puzzled, where he told scriptwriter "Mr. Fouad," saying: that the marginalized are not Manmcy buildings and housing, but They are ordinary people, the regime and his men from the rich and semi-intellectuals on the marginalized, Beneficiaries of the development of information technology and communications, to be able to create a generation of poor people has become mere objects of exploitation, instead of having to beg for bread became begging phone call or a football match. Here, regardless of that teacher, "Mr. Fouad" pitiful begging bread and considers the value of the lost, I thought - to Smajty - I will watch a film of value and depth, But Mr. Kamel Abu Ali - the film's producer - it struck me in my head when he said "What is much we need to smile smile on our faces in this charged atmosphere the problems of life, and because the people of Egypt I'm a joke is making fun of himself at times - is the one who said that I am not - so we made the movie to smile together. I became confused because the statement indicates just that I am Sachahd films for fun and fun only, and this is acceptable cinematically condition of nonsensical, but for my insistence on naive apparently, I imagined I Sohahd film combines the depth and with a smile, especially since the director is the "closeness" to the students creative late, "Youssef Chahine "But the film begins to completely eliminate all my misgivings, and the silent whispers in my mind, Especially when I realized - as a viewer - since the first moment I am in front of comedy depends primarily on Alaver thrown by the film's hero, "Amr Abdul Jalil" reproduced Dore ex-in my film, "When the soft" and "Haifa Wehbe," but only an area wider, and for the purpose in the same market, or, as usual, "Khaled Youssef" to take advantage of permanent capacity, "Ghada Abdel Razek," physical, Where by giving them special areas for the bonds without restriction or condition and, often without the need for dramatic - it is not logical in any scene outside her apartment to wear Ghada what she wore clothes appear more as obvious, but if they inhabit warm popular in Paris, "and because" Khaled Youssef "always looking for new and give a chance for a new generation of innovators, Gave a very special opportunity for artists "fairy" but not for representation, but only in the competition, "Ghada Abdel Razek," and truth be told brought this to the public teens movie joy and happiness. Because the screenplay sleazy story without a clear dramatic line or specific, And because "Khaled Youssef" always insisted on giving after the political or social to his films have Aihtmlha scenario has emerged the issues reviewed in the film, perverted and mutilated, it is the bread crisis and the theft of flour, encryption Alambarayat, deliberately satellite discredit Egypt to the use by some girls for stripping their bodies in the room chatting for material gain, But it was discussed fully and the initiation of the crudeness of very disturbing scenes without a sense of movement has one "Amr Abdul Jalil," introduced the first consumer starring the biggest pot in the history of cinema Alaverat during the first hour and a half of the film, before the director tries to give depth and meaning, it remains only a question of Amr, what then? I think it would be a faster end to the beginning of time-consuming - See Mohamed Saad Page Bulbs - "Ghada Abdel Razek," and all "fairy": dance, nudity and excessive cognizance and "Aahtvp" does not need to the representative only needs to ...... , Especially when the Ghada provided a real role in the "Haifa Wehbe" "Ramy Gheit:" I think it was a lead film of Donald Duck - Donald Duck with Arabic - using the same method of performance and tone of his voice in the character of artificial struggling to grab the audience laugh, is a successful experience at all, especially after the last special role in the "Haifa Wehbe" "Sabri Fawaz": point light only in the film, the performance of a simple, deliberate and tender within the limits of the role without limits, vitiated only scene crude after injuring his son's blindness sexual relations crude to address the sky - and that was a mistake, scriptwriter and director in the foundation - "the rest of the representatives of the business" and top of them, unfortunately, the artist "Shwikar," Why do you come and where you are and what you make Remains a question for the director of "Khaled Youssef," the impression "Youssef Chahine" your teacher, for such a film to see it - in particular, I searched for a cadre and one throughout the film tried to assuming it regardless of the meaning - and I did not finally succeed the film and will bring significant revenues, because the owners of industry issues and a smile specialist, led by new director masterpieces "Khaled Youssef" mastered cooking a combination cinema market Especially as more goods are selling cigarettes despite the fact that its pack containing a major headline is "watch out for smoking destroys health and causes of death" Rating: 4 / 10
