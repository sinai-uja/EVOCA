Movie Name: 8 GB Koshary lamps and Confectioner''Bulbs 8 GB''..... (June 29, 2010) (Poor) Author: Osama El Shazly s are completely Kosheri in Egypt, the Egyptian People's exclusive dish, which insists armourers Confectioner to add a word to the sign shop to provide a metaphor for a dish of milk rice pudding dish after Kosheri warm, The film Bulbs 8 GB is a mixture of several popular items for lovers of personal Bulbs - such as whole and the way of talking and some vocabulary - and but unfortunately not given the taste of a recipe and went out Kosheri consuming zero taste, color and smell, He insisted Mohamed Saad and scriptwriter Nader Salah El-Din to try and give depth to a film from the shifts in personal, poverty, childlessness, which has led - the side of the incident - to turn the hero of the personality of evil to trample on the necks of the people before their rights - and did not submit one case did the hero lawyer this On the contrary, saved the oppressed of the rope hanging in a rape case, Word of life for defending his land and his money - to be that deep in the end, a candy dish, which doth not false and does not sing about hunger, and even fails to erase the taste of warm Kosheri. Director Ashraf Fayek only move the camera and the manipulation Ballqtat between the big shot Shot Medium Close, and shot near the Close-up to review the expressions of personal Bulbs, without making any effort to direct traffic or representatives to take care of the details of any scene. Scriptwriter Nader Salah El-Din offers one of the weakest scenarios of comedy after the film is the verse of Mohammed Fouad and Ahmed Adam, and one of the weakest scenarios generally after the film Code 36, Mostafa Shaaban, only just stuffed Alayevihat returned and na√Øve, which does not laugh with the help and choose the hero of the movie, and comic events to the extent not not only ratified but laugh at the situation of the film.

Mai Ezz El Din made an honorary usual characters, accompanied by top stars and is content together without a real role, and it seems that removing it from the movie eyes of the artist Nour Tamer Hosny has paid to the presence in any film in the summer season. Majid Kedwany and victory Amkantma Kdratkma and also does not allow for such niceties, and the roles that detract both of you that do not add anything Film Bulbs 8 GB movie met him all the elements of failure, but he managed to ascend the throne in revenue in its first week, taking advantage of the desire of the public in the restoration of star Mohamed Saad, will lose a lot of these revenues after the disappointment, and will lose Mohamed Saad lot of its audience as a result of insistence on Alastshal .
