49 - Movie Name: Machine Gun Kelly Rating: 2 \ 5 A real person again, to those played by Charles Bronson here with the elite did not reach stardom at all. But unlike similar characters (Dlnger, Bape Weiss Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.) is less well known perhaps because he moved from bank robberies to kidnappings by the director filmed in ten days and this is clear on the score.
