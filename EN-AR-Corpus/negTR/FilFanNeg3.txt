Pomegranates and Myrrh, although the Palestinian film "Pomegranates and Myrrh," the participant in the contest of Arab Festival, Cairo Film Festival 33, discusses the Palestinian issue in a frank and clear but it is to his credit, not subject to any scene of explicit scenes of torture that we see daily in the news bulletins and newspapers. The story was in the movie "Pomegranates and Myrrh" normal and straightforward, but the ability of its author and the director Najwa Najjar art has been able to highlight the feelings of the representatives in a way obscure the high places of the existing shortcomings in the film. The film revolves in the "Ramallah" In recent years, although I could see that the meaning of time in the film is the only modern songs that came in the film and the use of "satellite" heroine of the film for mobile phones. It is possible to circulate the time, because the story had already spoken and repeated since 1948, shows the film society's perception of the Palestinian women imprisoned by the enemy without her husband to be tried without any convincing reason. The story about the "moon" - Yasmine al Masri - a girl dreamy loves to dance, finds herself alone after her husband is jailed, "Zaid" at the hands of Israeli forces, in addition to the pain of separation and Archaeological R-destructive colonial oppression, is to "moon" face restrictions imposed by society, tries to return to the dance, which i Alma Ahqth, and meet the band's new coach, "measured" - Ali Suleiman - a young Filst Winnie the return from Lebanon, and established a relationship based on their common love for dance, w m turn love on the one hand, "measured." And declares, "measured" his love for "the moon," after the departure of "increased" from prison, he is surprised and quietly replied that it is committed to her husband, however, and refuses to declare his love, although it was mentioned on the date of exercise, scramble to see it. Excelled "Zaid" - Ashraf Farah - in the role of the young lover of his land, who refuses to give them up for fear that it is inflicted shame signature on the paper waived and shall seal the IDF, in order to gain the issue of re-land, which put the Israeli government seized by Balgsb, churning Israeli lawyer. Of more scenes that I liked in the movie is the scene of the face of Palestinian citizenship "or Habib" - Hiam Abbas - of the Israeli soldiers after the imposition of a curfew on them for a long time, especially a tell them violently to speak Arabic, not Hebrew because they are in "Ramallah" and not in the "Tel Aviv "! I was hit by a state of amazement when he came out, "Zaid" from prison suddenly without knowing why he left, did not appear in the remaining period of the film which indicates that a waiver of land or that the period of his sentence ended, as the film ends without mentioning what will happen in a relationship of "satellite "B" Zaid "and" measured, "At the end of the film of the two smiled!! "Pomegranates and Myrrh" Film production is weak, and this was evident in the picture, but Najwa Najjar managed through the use of angles of camera and the size of the different shots, and good use of lighting to highlight the beauty of the image, also excelled in the delivery of many of the emotions through dance, "the moon," which reflected the Anfaladtha different, especially after the return of her husband and her dance in the mud. It is technically average film raises many of the conflicts, the most important conflict between Palestinian resident central events of his life under the Palestinian refugees have returned different ideas about the people of the country.
