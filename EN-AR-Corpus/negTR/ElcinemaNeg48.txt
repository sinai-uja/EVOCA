Movie Name: Hassan and Morcos Author: Hanafy as I do not know specifically of the blame on the director Debutante "Ramy Imam" or the author "Yusuf Railway"? Why give a very sensitive topic, such as sectarian strife now in Egypt to the author of the most famous works include "We are Malhish Bntbhdl", "cook the president" and "from a presidential decree." First, the film is expected to the maximum extent and if in some cases, con your expectations and falls to a lower level of abuses your expectations. All the positions ridiculous artificial to the extent that the children's play. And the most important thing lacking from the film plot. There was not any explanation (or at least convincing Tvsier) Why have heroes of the film to resort to these choices is logical. That he was arrested and detained on the heroes for the whole night and released in the morning without knowing the charge against them. On the other hand the output, there are a lot of scenes that should be deleted distant from the movie, like all scenes, "Ezzat Abu Ouf" and disturbing the person who continues to emerge to give him a mobile phone. I think the Egyptian taste higher. The same scene is returned in the same plot three times in the same way that he shot the third time in Chagrin prove to that person more annoying than a full four seconds without any sense before going to the next scene. And Oidaalmchd which show "Janet" and you can clearly vision nose Albulsticip full. And Phalacrocorax nigrogularis think that the spectacle of "Janet" from the window enough new. But it does not stop at this point but we see only three minutes wig "Janet" and is not insulting to her family before, "Mohamed Adel Imam." Excused the only person in the film is "Omar Sharif" because at least he was in a really more of a scene and but I can not explain why participated in such a film .......... Rating: 3 / 10
