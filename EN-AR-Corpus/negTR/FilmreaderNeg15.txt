Movie Name: Vera Cruz, Western | This time, Burt Lancaster plays a character enterprising crook on a journey with a partner warned (Gary Cooper) to Mexico after the Civil War to join the U.S. in search of those who pay more than the middle of another war between the government and the rebels. Agree on the transfer and protection of the Countess (Dennis Darcl), but the road is long and fraught with risk and the two men in a game of cat and mouse before they unite their efforts against the enemy. Appropriate to see the main representatives, each leading a different way. At the end of the movie entertaining, but not empty of good deeds, a boot to get to the bottom of Sam Pkinbah later better 0 Rating: 2.5 / 5
