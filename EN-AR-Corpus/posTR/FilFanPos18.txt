Morgan Ahmed Morgan I do not know a reason for this happiness that seemed Tatrini and I see an actor or actress admit their age at the same time practicing their art, and present roles fit that age and even make them motivated to ridicule, Adel Imam became a successful and strongly in this region the beginning of the "Experience the Danish" and "from a presidential decree," the latter end of his film "Morgan Ahmed Morgan." If you are taking on in front of his films, which started admitting to a year in which he always was the guy magician for women even at this age, and remain with his hands run down pens on the faces of each of the Yakblhm, which was not apparent strongly in his last film, appeared a man who ran him to life It builds his factories, combining funds between Iraq and Jordan. Home, which takes us by the director Jamil Ali Idris to the world of coral with Teeter Home, signs that fill the country bearing the name of Morgan Ahmed Morgan, water, iron and dairy and mobile networks, everything in the country opposite Idris in the world of coral, and reverse the wide world of business in the person of Morgan, Imam was a master of personal e typical carpet, drawing features Yusuf Mat J and Idris smoothly. He is the man who buys and sells everything, and keep his area alone could do for her anything, is his son Uday and his girl Alia, those who're paying for the elections of the People's Assembly, and the entry of the University to achieve a single goal, to make his children proud of him, after Aiarham many ignorant of their father's rich, especially with the smell of corruption around them wherever they go. Corruption, which reflected Mat J will prevent the coral from a T parchment good to see the respect in the eyes of the E, will continue buying and selling is its principle, in the deals drawn Idris Butt leaflet Karukatirip, may blow up in too deep laughter, was accustomed to with repeated bushy Lyra in the film, you will see buy divan of Stop and then submerged, to buy the hair after praise professors attributed to him, and buys his success in the articles of the university, and calls represented To me the Islamic trend, and excellence in sports and even the "Maximize the leaching of G and D" stand out funds Morgan and Jasmine Tea. Repetition of the scenes with the different issues raised by the injustice, the result is known, but make sure the result is what leads us to the scene of a very ironic, when the sick daughter of Morgan and lying in the hospital, silent, and tell him Dr. Jehan that her healing in the hands of God alone "does Strachey our Lord" to find out prayer for students from the assistant and his right to feed 650 Poor, and to send staff to the Hajj, a request for the healing of Alia through money. Dr. Jehan that is another story, Femirvat Amin was more radiant smile of the daughter of the twenties, and it's not depend on the experience beyond Omar Basma, but Mat Tha performance, and psychological comfort that broadcast Here the viewer as they appear on the screen, but did not play a role comedy in the match did not compete with the imam of one of them, but they Astt adopted seize the laughter in the hall They play the song "Boos El Wawa" for the Lebanese Haifa, and perhaps the last that attended the private view of the film at the Opera House was amazed Mervat of performance for the song, which give a lesson in Haifa v Alonot e Aldla upscale and T to sell me! Other roles was marginal and secondary schools for the most part, although the smile more than appeared on the leader fortunate, having noticed a scene that is beautiful in the hospital moved between their reactions simply, and features expressive and comfortable, made her appear before the leader and made him is also out some of his abilities in the performance of drama. The Ahmed Saadani, Sheriff Salama Omar Abdel Aziz did not experience the post, did not hold in Mhahdhm space for the performance of a tragedy, not in a position to Appear comedy in front of the Imam, on the contrary Mohammed Shoman, who gave the role of the right forearm, brilliantly confirms enable it Almmt's, especially that the role of a fee opens the way for the emergence of some thing in front of the leader, and was then Fortunately, his young and beautiful director Ahmad Makki, who added his famous "Heath M." to the film. "Morgan Ahmed Morgan" beautiful movie, but is somewhat too much and too many who wanted to Railway presented in the film, made him stand flying higher than their proximity sometimes to the surface in dealing with things, but comedy cute by mixing an imam with Idris Stnsec this matter, and Stzmta much as you can film truncates you of the owners of money and influence.
