Events are accelerating rapidly, and be the turning point when his friends to recognize the owner of Moroccan Muslims who influence it eventually, but you give up the criminal past and becomes a straight man? The analysis of the film Ventrkh this time to the brother Fuad Zoiriv *: create the film's French "prophet" directed by Jacques Audiard recently created a sensation among critics and filmmakers interested in the Arabs, as varied in their opinions between supporters around him for i Rha because it reflects the reality of France, between shows to see him because they are based on the direction of a racist anti-Islam on the one hand, and because they call into question the Arab integration into Western societies on the one hand all the utensils, and I have Ath Rana when we prepare for this paper is to move away from this controversy, and not to discuss the questions prove justified around him, overshadowed evoke the ideological background of the film, but we tried to quietly Open a window, albeit a narrow obligations technical, aesthetic, and technical, which met all the opinions. The movie "prophet" of films that leave its mark within the imagination of the viewer as soon as he left the room, and leave it flops in the quagmire of controversial questions between him and the same, and because it created controversy this movie is successful without a doubt, the film is far from those films that do not paint Ant Sold certain when the audience, which may be doomed Alandt R and evaporation Once the Jnrik the end, and the success I mean here is the success of art based on the technical processing and video of the event regardless of i oath of allegiance and the target from behind, to address successfully the film to use the privilege of being confounded to think Kjmhor , and left him stretched, and was fascinated by the image and i Leaflet installed and up-to-the context of the events, those that took place within the space that is limited and narrow - prison - used intelligently to give us a sense of fullness, sufficiency, and not resort to imagination to anticipate results or to predict, since we paid the director to deal with each scene separately as bar Stand-alone, has the end of its own, and immediately after the jump is another scene that has a beginning again, and the end of a different, and I think that the different tasks and the multiple and those to the ducks for the film owner (i Lahr, Most Merciful), whether inside or outside of prison, who was forced the director to follow these T leaflet in treatment. Characters the film "prophet" is dominated by mostly silent, despite this silence remains the body and eyes are the official Ct Rtan, languages, implied the charged atmosphere of conspiracy and malice prevailing inside the prison, but the film did not prejudice the ducks sell the case of the movement and violence in some scenes, movements disintegrate disintegration of the feelings of the main character, sometimes calm, full of love and perfume P, especially with his friend Riaz (Adel Al-Sharif) and his wife and his son, and sometimes the character is confused, and scared in front of the gang leader Corsican Cesare Luciani (Niels Arstrup), and at other times reflect another aspect of personality, a far cry from the owner of a young Pacific, to become at a certain moment to the whole man of violence and revenge And screaming, has appeared to us that is evident in some of the scenes of violent spectacle of the murder of homosexual prisoners, and guards on the scene Ijhazh leader of the gang, which cost to kill him. The film outlines that the prisoner owner, an Arab origin, does not know to read and write The Age of 19 Years, immediately after entering the prison the French become hostage to a gang Dzikip took advantage of his weakness, his age, lack of experience for the purposes of the criminal, to be the first task assigned to it i Rvhm is to kill another Arab pedophile, amount the owner when the gang leader Cesar to become the people closest to him and Auth anorexia has, because of the success achieved in the successive tasks, but faster and smarter , Creating for himself the owner of a clandestine network served his personal interests, either through its exploitation of the revenge of the Corsican leader in prison and stripped of Te shed, or through the use of the material and obtain protection. World of the film "prophet" the world is divided into two sides, the face is dominated by T Aba the magnitude of the humanitarian Att P love, and the world of It Follow-crime and brutality, and the thing The only common between these two worlds, is a personal owner of that move freely within these two worlds without boundaries and obstacles, this personal Triple Bias rate to live in dingy, dark basement, in the latter to become curious about spirit and existence, and without affiliation The reality to the real, complex character driven by circumstances to dance on the rope as a means of salvation, sometimes dominated by evil, and at other times take away T Iba desirous of a sense of her humanity and Binsantha usurped. Associated with T owner personal drama and humanitarian element from the beginning of the tape To an end, is if the job I want which to resign to dare the viewer to this personal, to become Msit Rh entirely on the feelings and feelings, and thus respond to them spontaneously and Ptat P is limited, although its behavior and acts of brutality and criminal in some cases, personal owner apparently through the context of the events (personal ore), recycled and formed through three main focus of s: the focus of E written, and the focus of e directorial, moved smoothly through them personal to settle at the end of stretch Bamaht F E last any mind of the recipient, to be formed as desired without imposing it imposed, and that the lack of stability, as well as free of memory or nostalgia, we pass through it to the past and thus discover the humanitarian dimension and depth of education, played an important role in pull us away from the analysis of components of personal and individual, and we approach directly from the analysis of existential philosophy and its relation to society and others. The choice of the overall structure of the two main characters coincidence it seems, Valtnaiip opposing them I want the delivery of a message, a message is reflected in the later sociological importance. Owner shall, Cesar, namely, the Arab and Corsican, namely, young man, Sheikh of the pyramid, two Aladt guide and Salt H, namely the lack of experience and expertise, namely, fear and security, namely poverty and wealth ... all Tdadat accompanied the two characters together, w Naiyat girl and wove scenes overshadowed placements pain humanitarian, and family breakdown and social isolation within the community of cruel, society can be French or Moroccan or Indian or U.S. or ... Adopted by the director in his portrayal of movie footage is very close (Very Close Up) to show the features of the characters and Taabiarham strongly, and this served, of course, the film has an essential function of several considerations the most important of silence accompanying the footage, the silence leaves features reflect more on the state or a particular position, especially for figures main owner, Cesar. The director did not neglect the general views (Long shot) in his portrayal, especially in the courtyard of the prison, in order to clearly highlights the movement of prisoners, and their relationship to each other. The camera is manipulated angles imaging accurately, has enabled us to We the public to communicate with representatives, and respond easily with the d√©cor, as it traveled from the corners of the vertical and especially in the cells to the corners at eye level and corners of the horizontal for people, also used the corner low (Low - angle shot ) In some cases, especially in the filming of Cesar even give him the necessary accompanying the gift of his character cruel and coarse. What a shame the movie in my absent of the female element and its dependence on some clamping s sporadic detracted from the role of women in general portrayed as either a blonde prostitute brought to prison for sexual entertainment and is not subject to either a woman does not shed and domesticated E have no opinion of her husband before and after him his friend - the wife of Riyadh Arabic - especially in the final scene, pornography, or a maid in the home stretch as the woman who cleaned clothes y. blood Malt owner, an Arab, also ... According to the film "prophet" to create and enjoy watching the film across the image saturated Paljmagliat technical, and language cinema chain absorbed the aesthetics of art free of random improvisation. Teamwork also played an important role in the success of the film and do not forget the significant role of the Department of Representative by director Jacques Audiard, as shown on the high heel in the selection and management, diagnosis and result well done to the qualified representatives of them stands the first time in front of the camera. For reference, the film has won several important international awards, among them, Louis Dolok award for best French film of 2009, the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival. Rating: 9.71/10
