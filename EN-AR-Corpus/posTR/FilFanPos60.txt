I do not recall the journey coach this young man that made a film suffered and wept longing of his face with the pain of love, it was always static, strong and cohesive as a hero and Persia Hammam, even in the feelings that were expressed to speak more than emotion, but Sakka here cried bitterly on lost love , influenced by his refusal to love another woman, and tension with receiving a new love. Mona Zaki embodied the role of the girl's T Iba wounded, who lived for years with the dream of first love intelligently, with great expressions of her excellence, to wake up after the word "was" and decides to move in her life, and Menna Shalaby, provided the role of the wife bakacad utensils people who are carpet e automatic, understand and attractive Mmtain, and glad tidings made the role of loving wife along due to the title of "Duck him in the world Louis Buz" very maturely and then a completely different Not for her film "The Kids fled," which compete with this movie in the same season the summer of 2006. The Ghada Abdel Razek, has suddenly returned this artist strongly unusual during her appearance in four films this year with "90 Minutes "and" return Alndlp "and" Z-Hawa "and" About Love and Passion "to find it different in each role and" colored "according to specification personal, but here excelled actually the same, I think she herself did not expect to receive this high-performance to this degree, especially in moments of anguish and fracture on the fate of her little sister, "Graduate." thinner i for i in the back of a strong personality in the role of Big Brother as usual, i And the time, but when he showed weakness of love against his will, was Mwt Ra with Ant Laq Awat Fe after concealment for several years to show us the thin and "strange" than for i in did not get used to it before, and Magdy Kamel "excelled" in his role prolific performer Drug well as "high", and contributed to make, which showed dark under the eyes and make them Jahztin i and the time to convince us how bad his health and At faithful. Khaled Saleh, who despite watching the few, it was beautiful in its role as a producer albums singing popular love Fatima (Ghada Abdel Razak), the main scene to him and which is taking place between him and Mona Zaki when trying to explain to her the reasons for his love for her sister and selected as a wife, despite its past, its notoriety was an important and strong, and I remember saying to him commented in my mind, "I am many people as possible Ngnelli .. Strong but difficult to sing high! " Camera director of photography Sameh Selim and illumination were appropriate to the content viewer, accustomed to his camera distinct and the court before in the "Tito" and "mafia" and "peace and the serpent," but I pick only on the lighting scene for Mona Zaki at the end of the film when it was accompanied by Sakka in the restaurant, because they showed severe defect in the make-up which showed a color and her face pale and opening more than the color of her arms. And skill Almuinterp our Farouk has been improving continuously and significantly from one movie to another, and so obvious since the Atpt them with the film "Les Khaltny I love you" to find it has started its work a distinct and pieces easy on the eye and events such as "Girls Town" and "Love" and "free from cholesterol "and finally our film today.

" "Teacher" Tamer Habib already prove to us with every movie that is better than "take up" the profession of writing the script and dialogue at the present time, and what more can I like about the movie after seeing it is that goes beyond the level of my expectations, which is what happened with the movie "About Love and passion." With what I heard in the news, which said the heroes each end that the film is a romantic and a new, Sakka himself said: "I am I will give a different color to what is provided," and director full Abu Zekri said it: "The film presents Look for romance", I expected the film to be romantic "cute" and fun in his dialogue as Audni talented screenwriter Habib after a "sleepless nights" and "Love".
