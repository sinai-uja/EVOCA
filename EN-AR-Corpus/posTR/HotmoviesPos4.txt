Moulin Rouge wrote: Slumdog Rating: 4 out of 5 Starring: Nicole Kidman, Yuan Mgregor, Jim Broadbent Director: Baz Luhrmann, 2001 One more thing I appreciate the work of Baz Luhrmann on this piece is his decision to re-glow of the classic musical Hollywood through the most difficult and complex its streets. . (Moulin Rouge) is a bit too hard in film music (but also difficult and palatability), where mixing fullness (visual) that can reach the degree of extravagance with the fullness (music) band that connects the degree of extravagance which is also the quality is not much favored by Hollywood .. Film's message is clear and simple and direct, but Baz Luhrmann is making for her a lot of work .. By contrast to the outlook express love between (the aristocracy) and (Bohemian) scatters Luhrmann visual sense of higher dimension, everything in this impressive work: places, clothing, decorations, photography, montage .. With fullness over the degree of saturation, which makes music musical dialogues which provided memorable moments in the march of musical films, a fullness of a kindergarten for Luhrmann to be a way to bypass the very simple construction of the action figures (which is taken on the film) .. Playing on some of the tendons to strengthen the melodramatic emotions carried by torrential Alhabiban to each other .. Overall an excellent film maker about feelings and love that never dies high service much chemistry between the yuan and Mgregor Nicole Kidman and excellent performances from the rest of the crew work ..
