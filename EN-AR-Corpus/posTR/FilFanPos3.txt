Scenario which was co-written by Abu Seif and Osman Shukri was harmonious and smooth in the transfer of the scenes from the stage to another during the film, though the whole movie is a story Iserdha other officer detective on "Job", and we have seen tragedy first and then we discovered their causes through the eye of that officer, but it was that was fun. Camera Tariq Tlemceni Balxiakp were characterized by simplicity and at the same time, was the control to play the role of the "eye" Ayoub tight at the beginning of the film significantly. As for the role that I find inspiration Shaheen is one of the best roles played by in her life, to serve mentally ill women living mind i Fella small, which is all the feelings of women and mother-love and fear heavily on her only son, I also found it daring highly of them that you Pettmt Yale's role or man and then by Ashraf Abdul Baqi, but in my opinion did not consider that this Sieibha, but Seth-bit capabilities and its ability Altmt Night high and adds to its growing degree of "privilege" with this role, has led Ashraf Abdul Baqi also the role of a wonderful and different from all HE has done before, like a kid again in this role and, indeed, of Ath-bit potential in that "carries" a film alone, and the return of immortality in this film after an absence of faq t 15 years from the screen It bit the artistic ability does not Tnt Vi, but returned a faq either mature T A form or the performance of A, and Bt sell can not add my words about "a thousand faces" Hassan Hosni nothing if confirmed his mastery of his role has been playing the role of the Yunis-class stretch of LÃ¼bbe and sufficient to see the spectator, "Dirt," the society in which we live and which led to the collapse of the Job "pure" in the end, as was the performance of Khaled Salih, a simple and understood the Clothing was appropriate for each character in the movie, as was also suitable for decorative work environments in the field of advertising. Moody Music Imam was fun and stimulating as it is required in the reviews, Moody's has added this movie to Imam tally new innovation in the field. Editing our Farouk came tight and "soft" this time, despite the fact that her last film "was a day of love" was not such a perfection, where he was a sharp and sudden, but it is in the movie Abussev able to achieve the difficult equation of transfer of the scenes from time to time , ie before and after the events, in a smooth and silky. Mohammed Abu Seif in general provides a new film his thought and style "Alvantezi" is different, has managed to harness all the factors at hand to guide the film "creamy" Despite the title, adding to the balance of all those who participated in which the degree of "privilege" to work.
