 4 - Movie Name: The Exorcism of Emily Rose  Rating: 8 / 10  The story revolves around the girl Emily Rose possessed by demonic get her family and seeks to rid it of it using both ways. Film contains dreary atmosphere appropriate for the terrible horror movies. Choosing a girl to speak languages such as Arabic was given a distinctive flavor to those snapshots. May be a clear fall in what is happening to try to address the girl and rituals and it is not logical. Film for a horror movie and nightmarish atmosphere is very appropriate.
