1 - Movie Name: The Karate Kid Rating: 7 / 10 The story revolves around a boy who lives with his mother in the United States and the circumstances that led them to migrate to China. Boy taste a new world and Bmngirath Sahvthm wretched and the lives of its subjects after tampering, which was experienced by States without a father. Know the boy on Mr Han (Jackie Chan) is responsible for maintenance in the home they lived. The role of events and the boy finds himself involved with some of the boys in fights because of the girl. Of the events will evolve to find the boy himself against his intrusive at the China Kung Fu, and Mr Han will be a mentor. (Saw the film for Tkmiloa events). Story is interesting too, and entertaining and the role of Jackie Chan somewhat different roles performed by (stay away from comedy bit), and that the boy in his first tournament, led the role of good, but the weaknesses in my view is in spite of the strength of the story, but find that the film ultimately is a life story of a boy abandoned by his father and the mother and father,, And went to live in a new society (I see a duplicate story hundreds of times in western films) and due to the disintegration of family content there. Other weakness is vanity West (U.S. children at the beginning of learning Kung-Fu) in a month or two be the champion China in the game and beat all his peers!
