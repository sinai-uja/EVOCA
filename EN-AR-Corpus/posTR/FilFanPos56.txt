The Fall of Baghdad, the first impression I got from watching the film "The Fall of Baghdad" by Hassan Hosni, Ahmed Eid, is that the uproar that preceded the presentation was much greater than it, although I acknowledge that I saw a new movie of its kind, full of positive aspects, although it contains the same defects and "sins" of Egyptian cinema! Movie idea is nice too, and provides an extremely positive, is the importance of Egypt should have a weapon to deter able to resist any attempt of external interference in its affairs so as not to repeat the tragedy of Iraq, and a few Egyptian films are exposed to positive thoughts and "national" in this way, most of the films shown Now in cinemas, and provided by the Egyptian cinema for years with nothing but the issues of infidelity and marital relations and Wales by ANA and customary marriages and sexual dysfunction and so on. But the movie, unfortunately fallen into the trap of his father and line construction and phrases Altmt Yale contrived by some of the armpit of the movie, especially a smile and a Almmt For whom he played her brother, it seemed to them that they represent, because in the theater of the university or in Thomas, and Erddan rhetoric about Alout faith and in Iraq and issues of the Arab nation can not be heard in virtually any person, even if and i Nia interested in issues Almnt Ge actually. Were also scenes of young people who are preparing publications and anti-American demonstrations also fabricated and exaggerated a lot, and was like a secret scenes political work underground in the movie "Man in Our House" things that no longer exists in our own day. And to escape from this trap - I mean vexatiousness trap and line his father - the star Hassan Hosni and ducks For the movie very talented Ahmed Eid, and the rest of the fight and then to Joseph David and Nabil el-Olt in Labib, in addition to family members of the "caretaker" Hassan Hosni and then for charity Kulaawi and the aura of luxury, these were helpful experience Altmt night in the provision of role stretch lube them without feeling any exaggeration in their performance, and here is the difference between the for and represented another. There is a fall the other occurred in the film appear to be convincing at all for the character of Hassan Hosni school principal, who says the scenario that he has a building and a garage Tmenhma more than two million pounds, and I do not know exactly where we can find this beholder millionaire, as the headmaster of the school - to my knowledge - is from low-income people in our society, the Egyptian! And fell His other is understandable in the film is how to evaluate the school principal training camp to take up arms in the garage Supplement Bamarth without the smell of Interior officials have any news? T in the countryside is that officials at the Ashent n knew then that there's this training camp, but the Egyptian authorities do not know s anything, and i have been and the film does not know something, too, but that whole movie was not any scene in which any officer Or even the sergeant! And Point for the other I did not like, namely, that the film - would like other than the rest of Egyptian films that are currently - portrayed the young people, all they Itat Wen banjo, and I'm here I want to make it clear to the director and all employees in the field film something important and they should believe him or not, a that the phenomenon of entanglement j Banjo cigarettes already in community Egyptian youth, but not this way, and if the banjo spread dramatically in the artistic community in particular, it does not mean that we offer in all our films on it and then for the sandwich beans, it is indispensable to any man with him, most of our young people safe, thank God, but not so bad, and most of them also does not Itat Wen alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, and perhaps the same, so why shoot banjo in films such as the degree of importance and proliferation? Why is portrayed as necessary for creativity, also appeared on the Duck's movie Ahmed Eid?! What interest of promoting this kind of behavioral patterns in our films? And when we see an Egyptian film without alcohol or banjo?! The end was truly flawed, and weakened bushy Lira power of the idea of the film and its credibility, way out arrived at what appears to be approaching a time of two hours, and it seems he wanted to finish the film in any way as happens in the rest of Egyptian films, we found a kind of "Alkrotp" in the last five minutes of the film is not unjustified and groundless Fair Valuable to them, and we were surprised American forces enter Egypt and the Egyptians dealt with by fighters with their weapons, including simple e invention of the duck's film genius inventor "i thinner," and the curtain came down on the film, and "lets all go!" But, so as not to depreciate the right one, film is the most powerful of which is his idea, or the message that he wants to say, a message meaningful, and perhaps close to the importance of the message that he wanted to just in front of before he shows it in the movie "Sleep in honey" when he wanted to say that negative suffered by the Egyptians is a case of impotence defective must be disposed of.
