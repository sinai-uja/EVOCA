Playtime Books: Ahmad Abou El Fadl, Rating: 5 out of 5 Starring: Jacques Tati, Barbara Dinic Directed by: Jacques Tati (1967) Does not resemble the experience of watching any film experience traditional view, there is no story, there is no hero or event, there is no specific place on the screen should look at it, there is nothing particular should be aware so as not to lose the relay, so little dialogue in the film is almost be heard, you just have to sit back of the comfortable and serene mood to see a movie fun. The film is a collection of sequences relatively long and in a few places dominated by the character of the city, all located in Paris, airport, restaurant, house, streets, a group of tourists visiting the city, a citizen naive - Mister Hollow - enters a building to implement the treatment of personal, upscale restaurant opening night reception of the first large crowds of people, including Mr Hulot and a group of tourists, Friend meets another in the street Vistdifa at his home for some time, and there is no particular link between these sequences but the spirit of public attitudes and consistency of motor and audio and visual collected in a film entitled "play time" for every movie clips are either long or medium, there is no Shots close, there is nothing that makes us want to come look at it, come wants us to turn our eyes on the screen, right, left, In forward or backward, to reflect on the people, interact with them in our own way, be possible for Ahtmalatna of these relationships and places and situations, so come give us the big picture to look inside for details We are of concern to us, introduce us to come in the world in two hours. Says Roger Ebert about the film: "Play Time, like Space Odyssey and Rachan Arc, these films are unique in themselves and die types at the moment of birth"
