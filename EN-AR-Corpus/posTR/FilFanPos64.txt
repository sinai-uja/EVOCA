Halim The problem of the film "Halim" is as much a love that enjoyed by his hero and star, is difficult for people to judge Zaki, see Iefr to stand in front of the camera and provides watch all this sense, to be neutral in his reign, and difficult to compare fans Halim neutrality between Matarbhm and Representative Al Asmar They see a clear difference in the figure, which was overshadowed by autism in the full spirit and personal representative, to the extent of matching. Strong start to the director Sheriff Arafa introduced viewers in an atmosphere broker t have the rest of the film, composed by Halim and his voice, the band, the same allowances that we saw in the recordings of rare nightingale, and even their instruments of ancient and i leaflet play, Astt Acts Arafah to feel the viewer that, in the backstage concert Halim , until the advent of the face Zaki, wearing the features of fatigue, disease and cohesion as much as Almstt Acts in front of his audience. When he might come out the scenes for a moment, outside Alit R. preliminary wanted Arafa, and he sees his star late in front of him, forgetting about a movie character, even brings us back voice Halim, who Hakah mouth and face Zaki, an unsung letter Halim under water, but what Hakah really was the fall of E unconscious because of illness, the moments that the imprisonment of Arafat's breath audience tense with camera movements, and expressions of fear for the public and features the band associated with the nightingale. T leaflet used by the skilled scriptwriter Mahfouz Abdel Rahman in the narrative of the events of the film reveal as much as a craft that yielded Tha years pen man, he knows the condition of the star of the film, and he knows how much information they want delivered, and attitudes, Noor Aziz pounds that must be reflected on the screen, which presented to the resourceful drama on which the movie, the dialogues press between Zaki, Gamal Soliman, which is told and remembered, during which Halim, life, people and events of. Such as those trick were not to succeed only in the presence of an efficient Muinterp such as Dalia Nasser, as characterized by smooth Qtatha full, and the movements of Slurring "Fading" was of great faq t, especially when transport between Zaki father to son, or between the center of events The studio closed on Zaki and Solomon, which although rested genius of late but is being held possibilities Solomon waited for the Egyptian public, Vchksip broadcaster and that although the faq R. personalities presence with Zaki great, but he was less characters Tot Lira him and the viewers themselves, except in the scenes banter that characterized Halim. With the emergence of Heath I m starting comparisons in the invasion of the mind scenes, especially when the scene is accompanied by a song for Halim, a comparison between the form and say form only between him and the Nightingale, and a comparison in performance between Heath M and his father, the two comparisons Latins Orvdahma, we will discuss all represented by, reflects on the personality , Bt Figure Mwt t sell strongly, but to be usurped by our assessment of the represented on the basis of form only This is unfair to him and personal. Form factor has not ignored the Arafa is important, so focused in our in It R-General for Halim through multiple items, do not let the viewer the ability to focus the difference in shape between Halim and Heath, the beginning of the songs that filled a large area of the film, passing through people Halim close associates and those who available in all of them form factor and performance Skilled team, the end of the wonderful decor and note the precise details that the viewer is in front of a documentary film for Halim neighborhood, and that this is the image of the real Halim and behind the camera. The trick succeeded by other Arafah to avoid an obstacle shape, is to read Halim from the eyes of those around him, and his relationship with them, such as the role of the Task violinists Halim, or the role of the young Yusuf Sharif, who like the tones in the garden Halim al-Andalus, his son and save his songs in 1957 , And then broken with Halim setback in June, expressed by the truly terrible, a journalist and poet Baha Sahin in the role of his father's genius and goodness, that with the fact that bilateral Halim successful. Personal that have had impact on its own and Ahssnaha was personal Ismail's brother, Halim, the largest, but was offset by a simplification of the relationship between him and Halim, especially as the performance artist Samira Abdul Aziz was full of emotion, and was likely to show a lot of expressions, but that scenario may be functioning in this way against his will because of Zaki. Mona Zaki, was living in a state, especially, the Anfaladtha smooth and deep and honest, represented her was Fawakhirji, which embodied the incision hidden in love Halim is completed, the romance between Heath M. wonderful duck leaflet makes the viewer forget that in front of film history, to see in front of him and the love story begins to break down, in the middle we see the face of Zaki, he is talking about, to increase the Tot Lira last Baltat With P-Halim - Zaki beloved heart with Elixir.
