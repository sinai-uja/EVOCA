Hostage in the beginning when I saw "Ovic" movie, which bears the image of mysterious features of the film's hero Bruce Willis, I admit that I did not was drawn towards it, you may Ecot why I did not see Willis in the film Action impressive since 1999 "The Sixth Since", and that his work I admire that followed after the group was "nice" light work of the ridiculous, or just because I am not in the "Filmood.NET Powered appropriate" in order to gravitate towards ambiguity and lack of clarity! I do not know, but I am enthusiastic about having someone I trust income in his mind and told me that "too rigid", Vchdjat to go to the cinema and watch "Anonymous". For the second time and this is something to Erihani gravitated toward "Teter" Home in the film, and what does not Brihni on this point is that I certainly would not be happy if I felt that I became "obsessed" Ptitrut movies! , And I liked Teeter this film "idea", the passage of the camera shots feel as formulaic, I've seen before in films such as "Spider Man", but this time they were not painted but is real footage was treated montage that gives you a feeling of paintings detailing severe, with regard to that way of writing the names of the participants in the film was funny. Film's director, Frenchman Florent Emilio Although it is a little production only two films, "Francei" origin such as "Nid de guêpes" in 2002, and the film "Une minute de silence" in 1998, but is characterized by high professionalism and clear with this movie, and the direction of the camera really impressed me, and I think that the presence of members of staff who had dealt with the director before in the previous few films to make them understanding was clearly evident in the film. Altmt Yale was convincing degree Mwt Rh, Bruce Willis Ath bit that he is still able to perform the roles of the drama and suffering that the show features a clear drop in the facial features and face, the boy between Foster, it was discovered again in this film, how it reflects on the madness and suffering and torment inside, through his eyes, and bakacad Atonic contradictory and strange that being with the girl Michelle Horn girl bakacad Hiroshima, which you do not know whether it was drawn to this crazy man who Ihtgerha or she was "terrified" him, and how the "strong" looks of the last between them before he changed his mind and throw the bomb in his hands between his feet instead of being thrown out! , The little boy Jimmy, an artist Piet small a great talent and has an automatic front of the camera has already envied. Director of Photography Coltelaci Giovanni has a long experience in the field of cinematography, but it has been working as assistant camera for a long time in a number of French and American films, most notably the film "Sabrina" in 1995 , And then served as portrayed in a number of films, including films Mkrzina Emilio three, may be this is why the image in the film enjoyable and exciting, and the lighting had a big role in the movie where you add the "Joe" a huge amount of uncertainty and dread as it is required to film. For editing the cooperation which the two Richard Biard and Oliver Gagan, and may be different "size" of experience between the two that led to a decline in "m" movie from time to time, where we find that Biard a great experience, "assistant" in the montage in a good number its film director Steven Spielberg's latest film "Catch me if u can" in 2002, while Gagan, participating in editing the number of all 6 movies, including film Emilio "Nid de gu ê pes ", But the editing was generally quick, mysterious, scary and wants to exit. The soundtrack was fantastic music, Alexandre Desplat, who has already well and that deal with Mkrzina in Vimelih former, as it was a fingerprint is also a fantastic must remember in the movie Nicole Kidman," Birth "in 2004 with director Jonathan Gelazar. At the end of my talk I see that the film "Hostage" of the few films that you can see more than once, and feel every time you raise the same view for the first time. User Rating: 4
