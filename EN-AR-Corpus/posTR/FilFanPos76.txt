Baby Doll Night "Baby Doll Night" on the film plane is one of the most powerful and "mature" Egyptian films, but it certainly does not serve the goal, "entertainment" to the public. Film and a very clear effort involved in physically and mentally and physically, too, production is clear, it is expensive, both between the number of stars which skip Z ten or quality of the picture you took him out, and physically from the effort of all employees of the represented Lin and represented journals, photographer and editor and the rest of the work, and mentally thinking done by the late Abdel-Hay Adeeb in connexion with writing the film and his son, director Adel Adeeb after him to embody all those icons on the screen. But I think that it does not serve the purpose of works of art, an "entertainment" from the public, it is full of political issues, symbols, codes and attitudes and the "details" in a "hurts" the heart. There may be situations and scenes of simple kidnap the star Mahmoud Abdul Aziz, to laughter from the audience, but quickly dissolve amid all the blood warm Isakbha writer in the lap of the viewer. I see that the film made from the ground up in order to "register" the period in which we live with all its pain and tragedy, its causes and consequences, from the viewpoint of the director and the author and the Arabs and some Americans. Vodeb introduces the viewer to a world tragedy of September 11th America and the case with the Arabs and the Americans, after all, whether in America or in Iraq or Palestine, but the details of caliber. He did not lose sight of the Abu Ghraib prison and how they were tortured Arabs at the hands of the Americans and the rape of men, but what landed m and breaking both saw the scene, which is where the falafel pw penis to one of the Arab detainees in detail the "horrendous" - will not try to burn the details of the film who did not watch linking events Bobt God - it is a scene truly terrifying and humiliating to the fullest extent, and will not blame the director attention to those details because it is clear that the goal of the film is "perpetuation of" acts of the Americans in the Arab onyx terrible in the memory of history, recorded live and better and clearer, but no less horrible for what happened In fact, published in newspapers and broadcast on satellite channels. How the world sees the whole of the Arab and foreign investors that the cause of what is happening now in the Middle East from the devastation and destruction and massacres is a fault of President George W. Bush, who actually made the state more state hateful in history, I think it defeated Hitler and even more than it deserved in achieving the highest percentage global hatred of all nationalities and religions. This is what the film wants to explain it through speech, in dialogues or even heroes in meaning between the lines and symbols encoded within the watch. Of course Adib request of the scenes throughout the film to focus without the "two classes" even for a second one to follow the events of the film, link, and they are listed, along with arms scenes of mental and intellectual abilities to understand and learn to be able to understand the film. This, in my opinion, what makes the movie a cash rather than public, ie, fit for viewing by those who want to stay for two hours and a quarter of a center and gather the details and data, this is not exposing the eye to scenes of harmless to the same determination, but it is stimulating, more than to be good for viewers who are looking for two hours, forgetting the concerns and laugh at any "how" and peace. Elements of the film are all fads, frankly, whether montage of me in spring, photography Amr Farouk, the soundtrack for the wonderful Yasser Abdel-Rahman, the author creative late Abdel Hay Adib and his son, filmmaker "thinker" Adel Adeeb, this is not all Almmt Lin who participated actually even Belkt e silent then for Ola Ghanem and Nicole Saba, or a few scenes and then Mahmoud's soldier and Ghada Abdel Razek and Dora and the names of the director Bakri, or armpit and then God's Mahmoud Abdel Aziz, Nour El-Sherif, Mahmoud benign and Solaf Fawakherji and Jamal Suleiman, Ahmed Makki, a nice salary and Leila Alawi and Ezzat Abu Ouf. I also believe that "Baby Doll Night" Ath-bit to the late writer Abdel Hay Adib begotten of the children - Media and producer Professor Emad El Din Adeeb (owner of Good News film's producer), Media Amr Adib (co-emergence of honor in the film and contributed to the huge propaganda to work, the director Adel Adeeb - what makes them exert all their effort, time and money in order to live forever his name in the history of World Cinema, which is the highest and his hat respectfully and truly appreciated. general assessment: 4
