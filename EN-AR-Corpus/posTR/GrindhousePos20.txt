Name of the movie: Grindhouse: Death Proof in recent years suffered a Hollywood of repetitive thoughts cheap in films and Tricks convertibles for all so that you can glance at the poster to know most of the film script, but there are some directors who are still rowing and did not drown in a sea of repetition yet, and they are considered rescuers from contemporary Hollywood, Them Alambdaan Koantin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, who recently collaborated on the work uniform, a strange, new, old, sexy, everything draws attention and makes him an excellent job, submit to the American cinema of the work of a comprehensive renewal and give lessons in how the new movies. Jernd House are the roles of cinema that emerged in the late sixties and early seventies, where they have abandoned the excitement, whether to raise Okhanip or sexual excitement, and this was only just to get the money, but after a few years of success has suffered this kind of films repetition killer boring, which made it disappear quickly, He wanted directors Koantin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez bring this kind of film today to renew and change the patterns of directing Alaatiadi that we see today, it was agreed the two to be operating all of them did not separate so that export together Kvlm one either cinema or CD-DVD (but was quickly separation of two movies in cinema because of suffering from losses and tent). Death Proof, Car of the ride does not die, anti-death on the extent of expression, in fact what he did Tarantino in his film this was something artful, artistic, and creative new sends it to viewers to make them live in a journey full of excitement and fear, the scenario in fact it was plain and not very interesting If thrown to him consideration, but the method is listed in the film was very smart, How Tarantino could attract the public to the idea of a normal scenario? Will not speak a lot about the idea not to sabotage the viewer, but you can be sure, the movie start with the beginnings of the coldest I've seen, but attractive, in a way Tarantino. Output was a revolutionary method of photography and motion, color and dark coloring, and ancient and modern camera and loud music and classical, All of this is in favor of the diligent work this out, we'll see a lot of quotes from old movies and how to remove them, and especially the Action of them, frankly I was recently watching some movies seventies, did not feel the difference thirty years of evolution when I saw the film Death Proof. This work had to be present even, and that was his idea R_khasih and old, but she said a renewal of the cinema and a change in some of the concepts, as has been mixing the new with the old ones.
