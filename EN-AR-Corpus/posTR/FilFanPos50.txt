Malaki Alexandria excitement is the most wanted Sandra from this movie, and wills connected through every detail in it, the beginning not to publish any news about it, or make heroes with information about their personalities, to Ovic the film, which is given attention do not realize many of our directors, and those who forget Alovic that is the address that may attract or alienate the viewer from the film. Since the first scene of the movie and the mystery entrenched in the mind of the viewer, and Sandra was able to view the video evidence flashback kind of crime thriller without showing scenes of blood interpolated, to play the other elements of a great music that expressed their position, and dim lighting, and camera movement. Hired Sandra experience of comedy in the output of the public from the action at intervals during the film, in order to retain factors of excitement in the highest, and in order not to lose the viewer a sense of excitement with the continuation of the influential and the performance of Khaled Saleh in those scenes comedy satisfactory, especially with the exit from the situation and not Ovihat interpolated . Archaeological Ball it wanted Sandra of the most difficult species that can Tkadihma, there must be time to follow all the details and forwarded to the destination one, and Sandra when I tried it and succeeded in many aspects but it failed in other aspects, such as the composition figure fully in the movie is not justified dramatic only to justify the events Important in the film, and here I mean a personal colleague of Montaser insecticide and Adham, who revealed the truth of "minty" valuable end, and by detecting the relationship between the Adham and charm and Zbbb in his class. That character did not have a place amid a professional law firm, which showed Sandra since the first few minutes over the professionalism of all its employees, how it Eogod figure somewhat stupid, but that the marginalization of those personal Sandra concealed by the shortage. Personalities that were neglected Sandra somewhat important, personal Fathi, Group I in the crime, and the engine of the events of the film through the stretch Imports with Adham, sending them off to the right side in the search for the offender, yes, personal Fathi was one of the biggest factors are vague, and confirmed by Sandra with music and Almwt felt Alidhae e accompanying personal appearance is always, however, that dumping in mystery did not create any line between the personal and the viewer, He did not give the opportunity to Mahmoud Abdul-singer to come out some of his abilities Altmt night and by Ath S in that it may appear one day if hired director and adventurer. This does not mean indifference Sandra only figures the tournament, had paid bribes advise me of the character and painted the details with precision and care, and it showed in every scene, and shaken, in one way or the pronunciation of the letters dealt with food and its looks during a conversation of others, and attaches to the rapid Bodhm. However, the faq R. characters that appeared in the image and then Mechanism was personal Leila embodied by light in an attempt to get out of It R. beautiful face and girls T Iba, since the clamping e first of the following is this stark makeup and appearance, which creates a kind of rejection prior to this character and disliked, did not change such a strong personality but with moments of weakness Ath remote Scenes of the trial and confrontation with Adham in the end, and expressed by the light of the ability of a large credit. Khaled Saleh reiterated that represented by competent, talented and has a Noor Aziz, seen to offer every time, regardless of where the personal, or size, and I liked strongly linked Sandra between version Ovic the film, which shows the benefit of sitting in the center of the rest of the characters, other than to appear as if Ct T, as through this Alovic the character of Victor strongly with the look capable of looks Zaki Rostom, which I find between him and Khaled to keep a big similarity with the difference to Rustam sell Bt. Ahmed Ezz was a good performance in this film, only the scenes they need him to see Noor Aziz, the sense of walking out of it is far from reality scene, for Almt The scene of the end between him and Ghada Adel, which focused the camera on the face of the Almighty, the lawyer who handed himself his wife to justice, and beloved, who discovered the deception his sweetheart after his years, but what a serious, we by the Almighty was not faq t just look phony. The Ghada Adel has made Sandra at their best, did not explain the beginning of the film outweigh any details of her innocence or condemnation, or make public or suspected loved it, and this counted strongly to Sandra, which is maintained in this way to keep the case of doubt. Sandra mastery of all instruments, and concerns to detail - regardless of naps simple - get out the possible characters that are being ignored by other filmmakers such as personal Shawki Omar Hussein and advise me, which came out at the hands of Sameh Abaiti and Khaled Zaki in a good picture with a very small space. The only character that did not speak about it until now is to advise or personal Moataz Mohamed Ragab, so I am very simple and did not find him again, or the general assessment: 4
