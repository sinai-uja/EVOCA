Movie Name: Arctic Tale - 2007 Arctic Tale is not dramatic wonderful was filmed with high professionalism and mastery of a unique, tells the story of a polar bear cub small Nano, and Silas - seal small and born in the same place of birth of the Nano, in the same month, in the same circumstances, and with the same challenges. Story begins at the moment generates nano and Silas in the Arctic (Alartek) is her twin brother, at the same time generating a flood, one of the seals (not seals but sea horse - Walrus of accuracy) and with the birth open weekend long way, accompanied by the mother punctuated by many difficulties and hardships and suffering. A representative segment of the film what distinguishes the film is the diagnosis or humanization. Since the beginning of the film is to give the names of the stars of the movie know by then. Polar bear named Nano, seal named Silas. This is not a mere formality, the fact is that the viewer be more serious in view of the film, and interact with him as if his heroes are real people, not just simply seal and polar bear at the other end of the world. This feature made the film to deliver a message more easily, and the same message more to address the human and more encroachment on to their feelings so you may wish to make you cry in some scenes in the film (for example, while the Nano or leaving them alone to face life's challenges and risks). The message is that climate changes experienced by the world as a result of human activities in it, which in turn lead to a real threat to the lives of not only the Nano and Sylla, but many other animal species and survival. Another observation is that the film is far from fatigue, which may be felt by the viewer of documentary films, this is not when a documentary but is actually a movie cameraman dramatically draws you to follow it and raises self-h, which at the same time a very rich information strange and very exciting. Wonderful and I recommend it strongly! Rating: 7 / 10
