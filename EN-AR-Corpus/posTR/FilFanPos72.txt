Game of Love may be surprised to know that the director Muhammad Ali offers a game of love film novelist T Will I, has been surprised faq t know that he worked as an assistant to directors Dawood Abdel Sayed, Youssef Chahine and Khaled Youssef, when he offered a film of its plot-coated abort R. comedy makes us wait Noor Aziz, seen from the cameras, which does not appear in any Tot T Bosatzth the above-mentioned, although the back of the experience gained by them, and with his short film and documentaries. Ali was not only developed expertise may not be suitable for a young face, as shown clamping the first e in the film face another duck for Khaled Abul-Naga, faq t automatic and expression, to provide a good role high performance curve, after Astt Acts for the viewer a little overlooked the fact that it is not represented, to live with him in personal fit Abul-Naga strongly, even ducks his leaflet, which reflected the fluctuation of its decisions, and not w Badtha At faithful to its principles. More helped Abu Naga on the quiet is his participation in the face of uncomfortable smile in more than one scene, one of the actresses who do not represent a burden on the Icharkhn scene, quiet and very suitable for the role of the wife digestible right, forgotten feelings, searching for love, who was assassinated Mutes doubles, and submitted to us by the author of short film is in violation, and humorously reminds us of their work first "king and writing." Giving more space for the scenario to appear as a force in the film, is that the heroes of the film of the young, a point of great work serves all stages, world of Abu Naga boring with his wife, and the failure that is looming on the horizon of their home is three years, we see in the model is quite different with Hind Sabri and Mohamed Suleiman. The same failure we see them, in a relationship like a marriage - and those who say that Egypt is not where this kind of relations to assure them of an error in their view - Even with the couple of liberation and emotion run high did not kill her marriage, but I discover the leak love of the hands, which was often forgotten with the four days, without facing a real problem. Provides us with the four models in the film for those who thought that love is put together, and then lost them later .. Couple Abul-Naga and smiles, and lovers of India and Solomon, and girls calling Bushra, which did not Tdhani the same search for love, but only in conjunction Social, and finally the guest of honor of the film, Menna Shalabi, Tamer Habib, the couple, who realized the loss of love of them, but they decided to deal with that reality without Mbalp , and a game of cat and mouse. The real turning point in the film begins to confront Abu Naga person before the closed preserve some thing and India liberalized released, which was once a friend of his younger sister, and has long suffered from his view of her as living in the wrong way, and its insistence on proving themselves in front of him, to find themselves working together, and another area to compete in the proof of the success of each of them in love. Here Ikt P scenario is a point of transformation in the lives of two characters very quickly, serve great music Tamer Crown, camera skilled Sameh Selim series, to see them and are staying their lives, current, and take India a difficult decision, but crucial to separate those who were depicted Hbhe only, while the attached Abu Naga resolution i for courteous of Basma, according to his personality is able to meet the then For those decisions, or a dramatic change of its core Itt a link e character of India, which began Tsit t he way of life.

Tuni was good tools in the film, which added a dose Maxvp of comedy, especially in a scene dinner, which raised Bhend and smiles and Abu-Naja, and performance of automatic very successful, but I take Ali his over-zealous use are exaggerated, such as its inability to distinguish his car, especially since the scenario situation comedy distinguish simple and natural. Among those who have made their role successfully Representative Boutros-Ghali, the new face of a relatively big screen, which appeared in the role of the manager friend of Abu El-Naga, to join Habib and Menna, who had their backs conciliator strongly, to add to the tools vital representatives succeeded in selecting strongly. "Game of Love" is not a sign of the cinema, positively or negatively, but beautiful movie, its representation automatically, and the idea of humanitarian simple and important, by the working group did not come down from its level at the same time not bear it beyond its capacity, especially in the framework Kom User Rating: 4
