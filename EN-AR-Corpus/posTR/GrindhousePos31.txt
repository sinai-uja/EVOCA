Name of the movie: Gone Baby Gone more than curious in the film is not that it is directed by Ben Affleck, or starring Casey Affleck (who loved his role in Jesse James), but he adapted from a novel of the same author of the novel magnificent Mystic River, but What a foil, I did not see anything new in the novel, but never a mere extension of the same scenario began in the novel "Mysterious River" with the change of personalities and how to reach to the end, And non-renewal and diversification did not hurt scenario, but hit the standard output of Ben Affleck, where you will not see at all what sets it apart from other directors intermediate level up, and did not have touches beautiful that can make a film level better than we see today, return to the point scenario, though he came by extension to the mysterious river, but it's still good, I do not know Is it a scenario, "the river mysterious" immortal and can be seen in any movie? Maybe, but what I liked in the script this time is reached by the end of the writer to peak in the difference of opinions and destinations, the end really made a wonderful film, and the making of the film performance was also made by the humanitarian Amy Ryan in the best roles ever, Hmat between women addicted and bad, which does not care for nothing but peace of mind, and between women broken heart due to the loss of her daughter seven years old, and all Alohadda based on this incident, the film is a heart begins kidnapping the girl child and to raise publicity about This incident and spread terror in the hearts of the surrounding population to their young children, In the meantime, the wife's brother and the girl's mother to seek help from two people work in editing and the search for Aldhaaiin, and from here comes the role of Casey Affleck and Monaghan in the film, frustrated a little bit of the role of Casey Affleck, who expected him to performance and better representation, especially after seeing his role Ripper Jesse James in the movie, the rest of the cast was normal, especially of the great Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris, Soundtrack in the film was excellent and no argument about this point is from the creator famous Harry Gregson-Williams, who gave us the earlier work of the musical Do not forget, Gone Baby Gone movie just beautiful, saved him the subject of the scenario and the representation of Amy Ryan, and a clear evolution in the level of output Ben Affleck, perhaps the beginning of the process stronger.
