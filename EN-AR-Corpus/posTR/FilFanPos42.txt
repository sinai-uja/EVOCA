Name the movie: The Departed "It is a nation of informers!" , Inter pronunciation of a guerrilla Irish in the movie "deviants" The Departed in his description of the American nation, a phrase he agreed with her more or less the film's director Martin Scorsese in a scene conclusion, where the camera focuses on a mouse running down the blind on the balcony of an apartment, and is well known that you listen to is called in the vernacular of America to "mouse" Rat. When finished Scorsese put his huge "Gangs of New York," Gangs of New York in 2002, it was apparent that his passion for filming gangland Boukbayah, events and Characters of non-traditional is not over yet, and it still has not bought a lot to offer us, and it was .. It came out this year's film "Perverts - according to the Egyptian translation of the film, which has not been the story of the film of any link!". When dealing with the text of the film, is in front of the director a T Riqin to Isllekema, either standing in front of the text or his successor, and is intended by this is either that the director would review all its directorial to become a filmmaker in the end is the main focus in the film, not the story, and there are filmmakers who owns the the courage to make it back down on specific features of directorial vision and personality to stand behind The story becomes Tkneckh harnessed to strengthen the story and show them in the best possible picture. Scorsese has done - which is no longer familiar in the recent period - is that he stands behind the story, as it gave up here about the features characterized Tkneckh in the last two films, "Gangs of Gotham these days" and "pilot" Aviator There is no corner of photography in an unusual, and the production of an impressive showing through representatives "adult" on the screen, what we see in this film is simply way out standing in the shadows to give us a text is not an easy approach to converting it into a story of a smooth and easy do not strain the viewer, if we look at for example the work of Michael Man in the movie "intruder" The Insider, or Oliver Stone's movie "good. F. K." JFK We will find that both the directors did not give up his attributes distinctive to serve the story, increasing both stories complicated Taqidahma and exhausted viewer, but Scorsese Astt Acts of experience and wisdom, and humility intelligent also, to give us a film you can see it and never expect this film to Scorsese, I think that this was the brightest and best and his line by the great director in his introduction to the story, not points E weakness Alit Laq as some might expect. Easy to download movie content of several political, and likened Characters and going on their relationships deeply interwoven and emits from the actions vary between vile and villainy sometimes, and nobility and sacrifice, sometimes another, can be likened to all of this with what goes on in the international community now and what role States have affected the Unit of the role of shame in the world, but I am not a supporter of downloading feature films theories of political does not say the film explicitly, but I expect to be dumping the film Bmt for such analysis, especially when our review of the personality of Jack Nicholson, which can be represented by to see some of the United States Kaajos Mngt RSS that is much more powerful. Unfortunately marred by some story points Weaknesses that we get used to in American cinema (and others) today, is Almnt oz The points which are always graduate from the context of the film there were many in this film, where we see Noor Aziz Seen from the behavior is justified or clear-cut, also did not see the depth of the characters we can understand the motives, and although the double life experienced by many of the characters in the film could have been given the guardian w behind the dramatic great, but this Almnt Ge did not see it in detail Alit on Laq. A new method characterized this screenplay is the start of each events - especially the relationship of figures to each other - from the mid-point, ie it does not come to us with assets of each relationship or event, but starts from the waist completely, and trying to you as a viewer that concludes unless the rumored events. These were probably good in some cases it led to a severe reduction in many of the events that needed clarification or justification to create a dramatic, leading to the occurrence of a type of imbalance in the understanding of logical decisions and reactions of the characters. Not spent a lot of time writing about the giant Jack Nicholson here, because it is short, can not someone write about the representation of Nicholson, go and see for yourself, that is the advice I give you, do not miss out on your chance to see one of the flags of representation in the history of world cinema, especially when have reached this stage of maturity and genius. This film is DiCaprio has completed the trilogy with Scorsese, and any observer I DiCaprio to ascertain the extent of benefit from that relationship, my delegation DiCaprio that we saw in "Titanic" and "beach" is the representative of a completely different from that which we see in "deviant", It is obvious that Scorsese - who considered it <User Rating: 5
