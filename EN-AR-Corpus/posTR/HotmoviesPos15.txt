Anatomy of a Murder wrote: Slumdog Rating: 5 out of 5 Starring: James Stewart, Lee Remick, George C. Scott Director: Otto Preminger (1959) Otto Preminger masterpiece, which tells the story of the controversy over the bilateral (rape) and (murder out of jealousy) syndrome .. What is happening at the fringes of war between trial revolves Begler lawyer (played by legendary James Stewart) and the Attorney-General (played by George C. Scott) .. What gives this film excellence in my opinion after me back to him is missed because he dared to discuss the controversial issue of her day (which is missed Hollywood films until the advent of the wave of the seventies revolutionary) to the ability of Preminger to make a 161-minute spin three-quarters in the courtroom without us to tend for a moment toward one of the parties .. Perhaps for the first time (I do not think I've seen others) tends to make the film the trial scenes looking for (the truth) more than anything else .. Tends to make it one of the twelve jurors .. Researchers amid this crowd of the truth (as is) .. And not the truth (as we like), which printed most films of this type .. Otto Preminger through its management of the lectures moral repeated on the lips of his characters makes it seem in the case, the whole envelope of a conflict of interest that surrounds the characters, and us - and this is the magic of film - and under the influence of these interests, we try to look for them to understand, and try to understand in order to we get to (the truth), the truth is coated, and vague, And which does not attempt to Preminger be adopted throughout this film in any way .. After me back for this film: This is the best movie going on in the corridors of the courts of all the work I've seen so far ..
