Mafeesh is like that from the witness the film "Small Dreams" and the events taking place in the heroic city of Suez, and the days of dark, difficult for him to believe that the camera is directed by Khalid Al-Haggar as directed by the film musical Review single "No not like that." For myself I am not a fan of musical movies do not tend taste to the review, but the stone has convinced me to stay in my seat until the end of his film at the Cairo Film Festival Bdorth of 30, and follow-up film singing it and dancing actress Nabila Ebeid, who made her first film in 1962, but can the center of seventeen song of the drama are intertwined and provide mounting. Home lyrical dancer for the film, and use them in our definition personalities and holding of drama may be a poor start some thing, despite the success of such start in convincing us that the film dancer, but I would have liked a smooth start to dance stone, Tmahdna to accept this much of the review is unusual for him in the Egyptian cinema. Especially as the stone after the end of the Home music moved to the quiet drama, to start the dance major film, which he refused to stone individually Nabila Ebeid on it, which added to the film and noble itself, they have been Almmt him able leadership Sawsan Badr, and behind them was the new face of Arwa, so over the first half of the film without the unique noble face - which Ilqubha bushy see Egypt's first star - a cadre of stone. From one scene to another was some insights displacement of the eye noble to the camera, but with the escalation of the events of the film, began to take, however, the viewer focus to moving it on the line of Wat dance stone, which picked up carefully between the scenario written dialogue ordinary and the musical dialogue, and even mix between dance The scene Altmt following in the speed and then As was the case with the discovery of a noble scene of the betrayal of a friend one of her clients with her husband, while the camera was dancing on the center of her daughter in the garden of the villa. Mother figure powerful obsession was the occasion for a noble strongly, but with the new stone is to add the dimension most far from ideal dull for such models, for example, the relationship with deep-daughter micro and clear in everything, both in Tdliha naturally, or preference for her eldest daughter, and even the disappearance of the last of any dream occur to her mother. Although the relationship was dry between mother Nahed and eldest daughter Rola Mahmoud and explained the positions most notably the scenario, there was no motive for hesitation Rola throughout the film, inter alia opera "I am Maine Bihbni, no and no end" After three times I heard them the same sentence and found something calling from inside : "O stone I understand it, this is the girl Alamadhdp poet injustice!". I think that the Egyptian audience loves to explore the truth himself, even if it was crystal clear, he hates that people come and say to him that the sun in the sky, even if the sun lit up, including taking his eyesight. The strange thing is that the sun stone, represented by in Rola, and painted with care and clarity in the scenario did not shine with the same clarity that resulted from ignoring her mother, her, Frola did not submit their credentials as an actress by both Dawood Abdel Sayed, Mohammed Khan from before, especially her emotions that were representative to a large extent. Unlike her younger sister, the new face of Arwa, which shined in the film as an actress, and the severity of the review is good, like Ahmed Azmi, which, although I space role, but he has been stuck in the periods of absence, because his character was indistinct, and he did what he has to confirm that those talent that we have seen in the movie "closed doors" will become more mature day by day. Sawsan Badr was the one who practiced hobby most of which are represented in that film, the happiness out of the same in every scene, even as she spoke, it was clear understanding between them and the world of stone, both as a music age Geert creative, or Bkadrath spoken and camera movements dance smoothly, and was Sawsan appearance in many situations a guarantor publish honest laughter in the hall. But the real gain, which gave us the stone with the return of color film review is Khaled Abu Naga in that dress loose, Abu Naja was automatically more than any role I've seen him before, the movements the dancer or the sense of the words of the songs a distinct, may be is Arwa better represented singing in the movie Stone. Stone was bold in his introduction to the world of industry stars, especially a game of chess spoken that competed in the mother's stubborn Nahed with the director "Fahloi" rare, or Abu al-Naja, and perhaps the duet between Abul-Naga and noble of the best songs of the film, and the same song Arwa "Bride Mariont" which Her words were beautiful and really sensitive. Perhaps the last scenes of the movie where the family gathered by the process, as long as the overall assessment P: 3
