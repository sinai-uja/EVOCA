Pomegranates and Myrrh in a time filled the screen televisions in the world in the Palestinian in the case of fighting a permanent, suffering and oppression, conflict and clash with the Israeli occupier, she saw a Palestinian director Najwa Najjar to make a movie offers all this suffering, but its part of human away from the scenes of outright conflict. Even when presented to the suffering of the Palestinian movement in the land, we have seen in a scene during the soft fluffy hero of the movie go to bring his wife on the night of the wedding, and difficulties faced when crossing the barrier, Fbd on the observational side, filled by the news. Story is very simple and his characters are limited, and therefore focused events, depicts the human relations within the family through a Christian Palestinian from Ramallah, marry her son (Zaid) Girl from Jerusalem (moon). Has been only a few days, to take a confrontation between the (increased) and the occupation soldiers who want to confiscate their land only source of income for him and his family, and when his refusal to be arrested and thrown in prison, where many Palestinian prisoners, and here the real beginning of the film. I believe that the main idea or main issue that has given us the film - i have not tried Lebaa Search For any kind of solutions may be provided, and then for those who take a single Affairs is and are waiting for the Arts to provide solutions to issues and problems - was for "moon," the young wife beautiful did not give them time opportunity to the joy of her marriage and her new life not on the level At the psychological and the physical level sensory after the arrest of her husband. And joined with her husband's denial of the denial of hobbies Archaeological Pounds, a dance, which Khaoip practiced with a team of Ramallah and imposed conditions for giving up hobbies for full-time home and work field and the sale of olives instead of her husband, and here we stand to watch the dispersion of the young wife, when her husband will come out of camp? Do you agree with i The heart of her mother and return to her family's home in Jerusalem? Or remain in the waiting her husband? Do you have hobbies in dance? Or give up their dreams and leave the actual circumstances of her life to come? Pt film with him after that decided to exercise her hobby next to do their job and care of house and land, of the experience At faithful dance instructor with the young man who declares her admiration for them, i was the admiration of one shelf is the i RV coach, but she did not respond to him and even faced him when he confessed to her that he is free to his feelings, but she does not feel towards him with something, and after a period of pining for the young wife to her husband, and lacks the feelings of both psychological and physical, no sooner had experienced until deprived of them after the arrest of her husband, which led to the tendency in the end to feel the desire to see her coach, but before that Taatt War these feelings have been released for the husband to leave him duck dance band and Tennessee coach and go to meet her husband's return. Such a relationship that has not been completed, and did not exceed Fantasies both (ducks him and dance instructor), given some considerable attention, and W Arua by refusing, what they see as an affront to the wives of the detainees, and the stigmatization of them with treason, while not seen as well, provides film is dealt with (the woman and the body) in the cinema Filst Linn√© for the first time, was treated with sensitivity and very technical paper and, through some of the references to the mutual desire, and the relationship with the body, and torn between duty and pleasure, and the need for personal and social duty. What gives me the conviction that his wife were not a traitor but was, like all human beings at the moment of need for love and tenderness, this scene, which directed by Najwa Najjar ably when I went heroine to visit her husband in prison and asked him a kiss from behind the wires are separated. It was clear that the Palestinian sad music that have been adopted mainly on the lute and the rhythm of the drum, used by the director, in addition to dancing, the equivalent objective of freedom. After the end of the movie, I added to the list of Israel's crimes other crime, which deprive us of the Palestinian enjoy movies, not something only for it and since in 48 Consumed Palestinian life at all levels of public and private, in all media, literature, music and drama, which is reflected on my vision for the film where I felt like I was seeing from behind a glass panel, robbed me of interaction with him.
