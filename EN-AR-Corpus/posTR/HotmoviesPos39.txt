Ran wrote: Ahmad Abou El Fadl, Rating: 5 out of 5 Starring: Tatsuya Nakaday, Deisukeh Rayo Directed by: Akira Corazawa Akira is the greatest director the transfer sagas of war history of the cinema in my opinion, the war in Ran is not event know it at the end of the vanquished and the victor are also used to , The war in Hollywood - also used - paragraph seven minutes are full of emotion and Asalomuscn surface and many of the blood and the movements "Call", but in the movie Ran, fighting is an important part of the fabric of the story and drama, battles can not be reduced, full of detail, and battle realistic strategy so to speak, Perhaps an experienced player of strategy games online like me can easily understand the meaning of resolution strategy that will enable Akira from the transfer of the battles of his films, and while seen I feel like in the battle, did not lose a sense of place and I'm watching the movie, many of the battles in the movies make me sometimes feel lost between the teams belligerent and who is attacking whom, and who comes from where, But in the Ran everything is clear, and most importantly that everything that is important. Film inspired by the drama of Shakespeare's King Lear, commander of the Japanese elderly divides his property to his three sons, and despite criticism of his youngest son for his decision for fear of it to his father and people of ill tempers of his brothers, except that the father carried out his decision, From here developed the contract Shakespearean sons, as well as conflicts among them and find the father the same sub-Disqualified in his previous at the hands of his sons to face node remorse and guilt, and fear, and the unit, Akira in its fifth and seventy - the time of the film - knows a lot for the Senate. "The Lord is the one who cry to us," Move the sentence the spirit of tragedy in the movie where the heroes are all walking towards the fate of sad and seems like an inevitable occurrence, and still feel regret that the father meets his son again after the bar to make sure that only one of his sons who deserves the confidence, ask him for forgiveness, ask just a little bit of time to tell his tales no Ihkha him before, But not giving him more than death, it was seen and was dead face of his son, and heard from afar after that things became clear to him, "Do you see his face now, would it seem to you a hypocrite?" At this particular point in the film, turning the film from a great film to great film in the list of favorites.
