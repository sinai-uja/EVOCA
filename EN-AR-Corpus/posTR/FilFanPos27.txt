King Kong beginning must admit that I have not seen the old copies of the movie "King Kong," whether in 1933 or 1976 , But I saw by some of the scenes of the older version only, but in the new version of the film Gorillas immortal in the history of world cinema enables the director Peter Jackson make a film dazzled the eye and mind potential Altkonologia developed that have already impressed the world in a series of films "Lord of the Rings" or Lord of the Rings. However, this time more than all the expectations that preceded see this movie, and will not be able to ignore talk about one of the scenes that line ft my breath for ten minutes complete and I was seeing, a scene Defending King Kong for his girl Blonde Anne against three e dinosaurs, how was tries to catch her w M pays a dinosaur, which suspended his teeth in his arm away from him and hits the other attached to his back to fall back toward the mountain behind him, w m hits two of them with each other, to find hits and one enters the bakacad I am in the deuce, to feel as if you see a fight real before your eyes, not on the movie screen, already the scene line P-breath sense of the word, to the extent that most of the cinema hall were applauded Kong after the end of the scene of his dazzling! The Jackson focused to show dialogue eyes between Kong and that, because it Btaia does not speak and would not understand, to find that you are sympathetic with it, although its shape horrible and his frightening most of the time, and feel like a child likes to laugh and play, and understand that the reason for attachment to the girl is that he feels lonely .. This focus on emotions really impressive. But Altt Will, who appeared in the film does not make sense, and I'm not talking about a period because the film was known about Jackson that filmmaker T and night "very" that can not be less than three hours, but what helped the sense of the duration of the film T and night is the question of "drag" events And scenes and details, because the first hour of the film was not Kong has emerged yet, Vtarafna armpit where the human inhabitants work stayed in P could be compensated in the scenes that appeared in the rest of the movie with Kong for treatment and then do not! Along that part of him on Skull Island, the people of black color is a plus I think he has no interest in, or add special events to have disappeared the rest of the film, although the bulk of the work is set on the island, where they went?! The acting was great, the beginning of Kong himself, which resulted in expressions of the face actor Andy Serkis, participating in the working face is also true role of the cooker vessel, but actually reactions Kong and he put his own eyes the remarkable than the skill of the image and performance together, and Naomi Watts, I've seen in a number of films such as "vicious" or The Ring two parts, or "21 grams" Grams 21 I think it is not and will not enjoy the performance of other personal as it did with Ann Darrow, because her character was full of emotion conflicting, and that looks eye that puzzled in accommodating and understanding why treatment Kong have to side trying to convey information to him by looks as he does the performance which makes you follow-up to what is happening to the other you understand what is being said without words. Genius with a view demented Jack Black was versed in the role - as usual - I do not forget his role in the movie "School of Rock" or School of Rock, 2003, which I find it introduced me to the possibilities of this man is amazing, but its role here has had a faq t from the scene of a single which showed his skill and his ability to express features his face and his eyes gaze, especially when the "wired" like under Tot See the genius of what, and the confusion feelings between his desire to implement what he wants and feelings of guilt if he did that was shown clearly in moments of "transient" It was inevitable it should not increase it, on the basis that troubleshooting a cold heart not only interested in his desire to implement what he wants and "salvation" Whatever bakacad or of the consequences. Adrien Brody winning an Oscar for his performance in the film "The Pianist" or The Pianist 2002 Not fascinating performance as much as Behrtni personal appeared in terms of love severe because the degree that makes him decide to search for his girl and Kong in the midst of the forest is indifferent to his life and his fate even though it has not been matched only by a short period, and Prodi himself introduced the Personal likable, but he did not put his mark on the work, I find that if performed by another person will not feel the difference! Dealing here with Andrew Jackson of the Essene, who was director of photography series of successful films "Lord of the Rings" to feel in harmony and understanding between the photographer and the director of the film image. And treated Jackson in "King Kong" with Jamie Slkrik Montier, who took part in a montage of four films from the director and they last parts of "Lord of the Rings" in 2003, and The Frighteners in 1996, and Heavenly Creatures and Ja Altqkim year: 4
