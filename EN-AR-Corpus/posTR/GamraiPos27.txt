 27 - Movie Name: The Kids are All Right Rating: 8 / 10 do not honestly know who the face of this film specifically, Since we are talking about not an American, Fessaorne curiosity greatly, how has the American public of the "normal" this movie, specifically, do you feel a bit strange, to complete registration of family life, where everything is normal, someone Donate fluid is vital to meet some of the money, come and Tstamlanh Haztan two women after their dealings with the sperm bank, I felt most of the film, something false takes every relationship, Claim the basis of objective Sami, namely, with the lofty goal due to the establishment of any bond of a natural marriage, is the creation of family and the preservation of stability and cohesion, said that the relationship between these two dignitaries were not motivated by love and that was odd, it was some kind of commitment to family, or, rather, building a family with a semblance of normalcy, Through the two meet way their thinking comfortably helps to establish long-term relationship is surrounded by a stable, successful participation, as evidenced not, however, the time period initiated by the film, 18 years after gay marriage, and here you can ask, why did not The story begins with the beginning of this relationship,? Everything in the film refers to a specific abnormality, has been filmed, I analyzed through the points of view, But it is mockery of the lifestyle of a contemporary, from which to resort to more feasible solution, even if socially or naturally abnormally, not least because, only a subtle great director, this work filming the meeting of this family several times around the TV broadcast one channel namely Nahenal Giogravk. Or that kind of photography the ability of any relationship, to create a healthy reality, it creates the children, properly, Here also provided us with the director and convincing evidence, because you'll find that this family literature concerned, and directing educational particular helped a lot in guiding this message, and this is clear from the title of the film "The kids are fine" on the other hand, the director did not stop at a roadblock to justify these points only, but moved away more to visualize the relationship of the same from other angles, You will find that the entry of the young normal "Mark Rovelo" The life of this family that have been built in a natural and healthy, why type of disclosure, on both sides of this relationship, make them feel oddly what they are doing, despite their acceptance of it, and put them in front of the nature of their relationship, which raised essentially as if they were family relationship, rather than a characterization of the anomaly, Jules relationship of sex with donor Tnav, Not described as a betrayal, this word did not say no once to describe with your likes Julianne Moore with Mark Rovelo, but seemed to evade the duty of the prisoners,, get out of social obligation, Johnny daughter, was one of the factors revealed by the quality of this relationship and its negative impact, it seemed to a young man kissing scene Tstlotfh, plus normal, but seemed to sensuality, The fact that the climate in which lived the loss of any intimate, for any emotion, just any emotion, "normal", so you will see that everything that happens after this relationship, "normally" is wrong, ((the normal relationship that had developed between Julian Moore and Mark Rovelo seemed wrong not because they betray the viscosity, but because it is abnormal)) There is something I could not be cited, in the map of this film, because it explicitly, No multi-pronged and details of many important, namely, the relationship sons, Bosedkaihma, and the quality of this companionship, P of the girl friend of turning any track interview with the sex, too, and had sexual overtones, as if put this detail in the film suggests that nature is not determined by Only sexual orientation, is what these girls had sexual overtones, is normal? , Although the natural tendencies, Friend of another son, a person's dirty,, long tongue, and insulted constantly using the words sexually degrading, Is this also something natural, as if the director says to viewers, Bring your assessment of what is normal and what is abnormal, Valmhosp sex and the boy dirty long tongue no less an anomaly for the film, where she ..!! In the end, I watched the opening movie, I asked myself the question, why I watch this movie, Is there a need, it not curious to see the details of how the quality of relationships and how to deal edges with each other and with their community and what is their lifestyle, as you continue watching, but with the passage of minutes, the film you will find yourself compelled to complement it, for thou art in the heart of the turmoil of contradictions of this relationship, especially with the entry of Personal Mark Rovillo Chamber events, and, especially, You'll find some of the unveiling of falsity so relationships, and the falsity of their goals, no matter how sublime, and actually started I am curious about the position of the American society proper of such a relationship, it being advocated by this means he accepts it, processing, film drama of high-level Stdtrk accountable for these things, strong performances from all the film crew, and director had already Midhnaha enough at the top.
