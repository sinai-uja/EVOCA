 22 - Movie Name: Rebecca Rating: 9 / 10 did not see him with all of Sir Alfred Hitchcock, I have a growing sense of guilt, because I came across time, which I have seen all the Hitchcock films, Will I gained after that time enjoyable viewing experience Hechkokip for the first time, after 15 did not for this giant of England, I still ask the binge, his films, and continues to raise Hitchcock, and its strange to urge the adrenaline to flow in my veins, made me feel excited, for any date did not join me in any of his films, Rebecca made by Hollywood in the year 40,, It is the first Hollywood film to offer in that time after arriving in her film .. Then I felt Hollywood hurricane coming their country of fog and ambiguity, Vokrmth Booscarha for best film, the first and last, despite the fact that his rivals in that year, did not Igulwa affair with him, as John Ford's Grapes of Wrath, and the dictator, the great great short Charlie Chaplin, , and the letter to William Wyler, The story of Philadelphia, George Coker his film that has been built on more than one level, the story of romance in the opening, mental health treatment for the character, the new wife in the boot, and the detective story and the strength of the prosecution and judicial investigation, before the conclusion, and conclusion sudden with the psychological impact of deep, as Seiko 1960, the film talks about a girl with a modest social background, Exclamation point during her visit to Montecarlo man much like the prince of Monaco is currently, lost his wife Rebecca recently, live period of grief for the loss, and arise between them in a love affair mysterious reasons and monuments, Laurence Olivier gave the role of Maxim, mysterious man rich, who lost his wife, and Jane Fontaine, a woman who married her out of selfishness to get rid of the past soon, Vtghebrha those conditions and because of her love virgin has to be dragged to the yarn past, at some stage feel as if they want to switch, you want to be Rebecca at the same time that you do not want to hear her name across the Palace Manederlai, to be clarified for her features of the story, for a moment you will feel, that the heroine Rebecca film missing, will be the cause of the collapse of the new wife, After it arrived already to the brink of collapse, and, in other periods, you will feel it has not been already, that comes the role of Hitchcock, to motivate you in the middle of the maze and let you before to come and Ishabk ultimately stunned, methods of technical images by Hitchcock film this was a precedent for its time, is enough to see the final scene and the camera rotation at the same time that the process of doing unnecessary sharp, Even his style in adapting the shadows to make a halo mysterious of all things, Hitchcock can make you doubt yourself, in my opinion, if the picture Hitchcock this film in the period in which to imagine the film in color, the picture film is not black and white, because that would leave Tmchiha mystery at all, and the large number of joints and Mnattvath surprise to Lawrence Olivier, in my opinion, gave one of the best performances Hitchcock films, Along with James Stewart in Rear Window and Ray Meland in the press or to be killed, Laurence Olivier coming from the background of the play, he radiates a scarf of ambiguity and uncertainty, a dynamic practical speaks quickly but with no life, difficult to assess the features and their Meanings, and, for his performance is very mature performance for the history of film Jane Fontaine is the other performers were great, We are used to women Hitchcock assimilative capacity, high, and here almost Fontaine that the volatility of some of the events upside down as a result of the strong to enable it to flirt with the viewer eyes Kjlten Almrtbektin film in my opinion, what is missing, is that the investigator light shade comedy, which we used in the Hitchcock films.
