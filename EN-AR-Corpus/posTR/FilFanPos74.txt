Betrayal of legitimate you wanted Khaled Youssef through his portrayal of Robin Hood, the thief-Sharif, which robs the rich to the poor, and we see him take revenge on society, "the rich inertial Uwe", as the hero of the movie for himself and his family, or the film was an attempt to make action films literally high, to open the door to the Egyptian cinema for a new type of film. Itchy Joseph scenario like a piece of art is complex, the events are complex, and the reporting of smooth and fast with the flashback and the present, and the presentation of rapid and profound at the same time the characters are all, which made the viewer in a state of alert permanent, to track events fast, and dive into the borders of each figure. Will not be a "betrayal of legitimate" favorite movie amateur calm And visually impaired nerves, most periods of the film was a storm and then for the start, and the Archaeological ball is an attribute Alokt R. presence in the watch, especially with how many battles and fights are submitted by Joseph, which he has served Ptgmh Able in the rest of its elements, from lighting e i selling reviewed by the skill at the outset, and with a camera capable of taking into account all the details of interest to Joseph, then For small images of the couple "Hisham" and his wife, "Nahla", and follow-up rapid movement. Complex interdependence of events will force any analyst of the film to follow through his characters, each individually, especially with the help of Joseph Lin represented the focus in the depths of the degree of honesty, including Joseph himself, who stares across the simple AH personal position, which has advocated the principles of many, waived with the first real test, which is what we've seen in a scene between disclosure counsel "answer" and he pointed out the excesses of the employee directors "perfection" of Joseph, who appeared with him in front of his camera in a few scenes.

The selection of personal Hisham Beheiri to take a voiceover successful because it created somehow familiar more with the personal, which was condemned last thing he wanted Joseph to reach the viewer, and this was a personal oscillating between the location of the victim and the offender in periods of very close, and even Mchdha final, was the murder of his sweetheart the previous "Saw" in connexion with Attempting to kill, "Mary" in place of encouragement, because it saved this personal Alokt t i Iba in the film, and suddenly that even Mary Nkstv Hisham fooled when I told him the news of her pregnancy false.
