Malaki Alexandria returned young director Sandra arose after an absence of two years on the artistic scene in the spirit of guerrilla-style comedy films in the usual public and decided to start their own risk and in providing a new look and a different quality of the films did not see the cinema in Egypt since nearly to the 30 Year, providing us the kind of "crime" of the magnitude of this type of excitement and surprises and "Batat" for the spectators, and although in the end the film "Egypt" with limited possibilities for foreign films made of the same type, except that the mere definition, provide a new style is an effort "thanks" on it strongly. In terms of lost output of Ath Decided by Sandra in this film as having the potential professionalism, has Istt adopted to control elements of the work at hand is high, although there are some reservations as he appeared on screen for Almt the speed camera performance, as well as editing the score Their high speed in the course of events In front of the viewer, and this property may be a double edged sword, it might help the viewer to focus faq t to follow events, or it will lead to disturbed to find himself was a group of film, but style and "technique" a new you used Sandra to help the atmosphere of the Archaeological ball events. For the story, is made of product innovation and Wael Abdullah producer of the film, we may find in the coming period, the spread of the phenomenon of producers to choose films themes and script of the story, because that is their point of view will be a source of profit required! , But the plot of the story is not strong or convincing, and screenplay and dialogue Mohamed operations did not help a lot of persuasion as "sold it" carried by the film, though the process of ex-"Tito", and "Snakes And Ladders" have prompted a great deal of admiration the public, but in general the idea of "crime" itself is what will count for this film. Altmt Yale was not a high level of performance, Valmmt By Ahmed Ezz feel like not faq t of a pretty face on the screen, and it did not "mature" after the performance or expressions, and Ghada Adel, this role was the largest of its potential, and advise on Alit Laq watching scenes of crying their own because they are not convincing, but This show is a surprise, "Nur Lebanese" which, although few of her scenes but that the "New Look", which was developed by the Tot Seen directly on the viewer is that he has to hate her even though it has not made any effort more than they appeared in front of him, and that the last scene with them was strong already feel they have been wronged, as well as "the owner of the large crowd," Khaled Saleh, who was a role here, the increased emphasis on the potential "beautiful", and Riham Abdul Ghafoor did not add anything to her new movie, and I think it did not show her talent yet Any work to it now, Mohammed Rajab did not feel the difference of course on the roles performed by, a role Archaeological hypocrisy spoiled son of "brazen" in some cases. Camera young photographer Nizar Shaker was obedient to visualize the director, but that the number of stills animated "Ahaeriwa" not being able to keep the picture clarity is required all the time, but despite that, there is a clear distinction between his work in this film and his previous work in "Love" appears he gained experience and a new way after dealing with the experience of Sandra. Meanwhile montage showed me the spring is the other skill of severe in this movie, and I liked the part that detects where the lawyer "Batp," There is also a noticeable difference in the level of work between this film and her previous films latest of which was "Abu Ali," and "case love ". The soundtrack features the film with strong music Yasser Abdel Rahman, who "Athva" by his work in the movie "Days of Sadat". We therefore find that Sandra grew up made a great effort and clear in the film "Malaki Alexandria", it will be taken into account out of the ordinary and its contribution in the provision of a new type of films seasons.
