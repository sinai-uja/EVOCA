Embassy in the building may be Sheriff Khairy is the duck's the only one who appeared on the screen, but the armpit of the real, in my view are those who hold him in demonstrations of the film, and shouted to him and against him, Fshariv charitable person, or makeup, the Gulf states Vodhaa the old, also impressed the director of the film parameters of the UAE donating Teter Teter movie to a documentary film does not die for nothing - it may be a condition UAE government to allow filming the movie! - Drawing Arafa features personal charity very carefully, and the background that produced in this fashion, a man who lost his parents, has no family, does not know in this world only two things money provided by his work, and women who spend his birthdays daily! Khairy was honest with himself, and with the other until we see him speaking with his friend Eyad'm Filst Lenny himself that has nothing to do with politics, does not represent for him Alout n only other place where, repeating in front of Iyad names of world leaders and figures of Security Council resolutions, and smiling he hears hopes of T fell in the liberation and i NH and participation in the uprising, while describing himself as "loves Almkn," out of the pocket guide passion, betrayal and a guide to the director in the sunken well the other is treason. After the few instances in the UAE and is the marvelous keenness of Arafah to clarify, he finds a charity has been forced to return to and i NH, do not miss Arafa opportunity to confirm continue the relationship At faithful to the only honest in the lives of ducks has a love Ellat Phil Iyad, Viqahm scene rescue T fell for the elderly Great in front of a speeding vehicle, in a scene is quite convincing, w m give him a ride to T fell stretch R to go back to NH and i that does not mean anything to him. In the plane does not stop a charity to pursue his hobby, "Imami" in the rhythm of all female pass in front of him, and despite the attempts of Arafah severe to curtail this hobby of old, but the air hostess that fall in love with the charity first glance I did not find it justified, but being the cause of dialogue Laugher between charity and the security officer who shall Khalid Sarhan. The sight of the entry just before the flat return to it after years of faq R. scenes w behind, though caution Arafa your feelings held by the Imam of the old, to output the scene better Bkt seen, there is no meaning never going to paint the back of the imam as he explores his apartment, and was the best follow-up to face the camera for filming and diversification from the perspective of a cat s eye ducks For, but that the end of the scene and the discovery of a charity for the existence of the Israeli embassy next to him was excellent, especially with the wonderful music of Omar Khayrat. Rapid reaction charity i was very Bieia, reaction At in quickly still Ath Rh with the advent of the host glamorous, forgotten it, and forgot the Star of David, but from around the charity are beginning to turn, the beginning of the Seller Alaft See who reject, with a girl through the night "cartoons" which refuses funds from a neighbor Israelis, leading to a Friend stitch newspaper journalist "no" rejection of all things, even though he lives in a world of blue smoke. Alit R., who returned to charity once again, is the same as that came out of him for more than a quarter of a century, to see comrades Iltamon of the new Sheriff Khairy "Crying Jazz", and the lawyer corrupt, and the journalist refuses, and Dr. Albit Rey, four men gathered stones "shisha stuffed with hashish "In the midst of this fog concealed It Khairy welcomed his problem in the presence of the embassy in his building, and the presence of Ambassador with him in "Alosancir" and summarized in "O and C only", to turn the press on his partner in the "stitch" echoing the words poem hope Denkul "I do not reconcile." Here, ask a question on who attacked the imam and his film just because it is not words of a poem, whichever believe .. Sharif, a charity which knows only the "stones rose up" and did not hear one day for the peace between Egypt and Israel does not mean it in something, or an opposition journalist who says the words of the poem and the smoke comes out of his mouth, and he himself who smokes in an apartment his friend, who called the customer after it found from safety factors over buoy corrupt lawyer?! Point E major transformation in the film begins with the proposal devilish lawyer to sue the Embassy for i response of architecture, in order to enjoy the Sheriff to speak and compensation Amalie, bringing the name of the Sheriff Khairy to the sky, "Sheriff Khairy code steadfastness," Here we discover how to make the public symbols Alout Faith, charity Fshariv which came just a demonstration of his admiration for Bakaidtha, he became a cause and a leader of the demonstrations, and became the people closest to him those involved in the industry, Wasit, and dysarthria empty, are the biggest promoters of ducks and Lth delusional. The center of successive events appeared minor figures are many, I do not know why deliberately Arafa marginalized and show up as a caricature, such as Khalid Sarhan in the role of the security officer, as well as the facilitator in the role of a girl night national, was personal Israeli ambassador to the importance of closer to falling into this general assessment: 4
