King, writing "Benign king and the rest writing" these words are what reduced the movie to a friend asked me about my opinion, Valmkrjp employed every possible means to enable the benign from appearing in this form, and perhaps the nature of the scenario that revolve around the orbit of character, Dr. Mahmoud given by is what forced the Abu memory on the this, but on the other hand the efforts made her lose my talent Hind Sabri, Khaled Abul-Naga. Beginning of the film may be one of the strongest entrusted s in it, both in terms of style photography, and the soundtrack is the kind that brought us to the world of Dr. Mahmoud and his wife, a few minutes was cut short by his previous life, and paved the way for coming over the whole film, which may see some flaw in you Tstt p expect next, but coercion is Fair Valuable needs this kind of film which tells the story of life engulf, but what I find fault in those scenes, but in the entire movie is the audio commentary. Valmkrjp able to deliver what you want the picture, good sound and has not added anything new to the scene, but may be distracting to focus the viewer, scenes full of beautifully crafted expressions of benign and Aida Riad Tnt s that have not any word, deserved appreciation and admiration Kitt They see the courage to accept and then for this role, especially with its importance in the course of events of the film, and was the last cat e her the best farewell to the viewer, a clamping AH discover where her husband's infidelity, and signed by everyone in the room, to begin another phase of the life of ducks we do not know We do not know how will be. The reaction of benign shocking, but realistic to the fullest extent, scenes were like him, knew from the beginning that that moment is bound to come, but he has lost the ability to think when faced, and perhaps the emergence of Lotfi Labib friend benign at that time was successful, His presence fun, and simplicity in performance have softened the dose of melodrama which fills the film after the occurrence of treason. Another point is calculated for the full, and retaining their leaves between successful and non-rush projecting, and here I mean the Tunisian Hind Sabri, which emphasizes the movie to another talent high, which was delayed appearance of the hand more space to the commander of Symphony benign, and provided the expectation of the public, which made many of those who were in the room say, "I AM India Gat." Began facing bilateral between India and benign, Bchkisathma opposing, at the same time needing to each other, and served as the antithesis personalities, and even film in general, Vhend able to change the lives of benign smoothly according to the scenario in strongly clarified. Weakness is that I find in the scenario is the marginalization of the role of Khaled Abu El Naga, which I think is important, if not in terms of the importance of his character as a separate element of the film, will have important influence on India, as well as for that other situation changed at the hands of India, like benign. Camera Ahmed Morsi was smooth in most movements, but as it may deem scenes exaggerated are the angles of photography alien who insisted fully used, and the insistence excessive use of zoom it is not luck at all, it is in terms of stressful represented by its focus on all the emotions and face On the other hand affects the viewer bored with repetition, which is what happened Indeed, were killed in what may add a full body as a whole as a means of expression, and may add the place and atmosphere. Music of the film was good, especially in the first scenes, and was to appear as a background to the voice of good points in favor of Khalid Shukri, as we have been successful Almuinterp Farouk over the film in general, although not without command from the sudden interruption of a benign, with scenes of India! "The King and typing" film makes everyone who sees it to rethink his life again, not even one day become like the hero of the movie who said, "every need of its currency in my life out of fear, calls it something else they really are!"
