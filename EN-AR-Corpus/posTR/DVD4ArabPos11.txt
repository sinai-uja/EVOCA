11 - Movie Name: Red cliff 2 Rating: 8.5/10 The story revolves around conflicts factions in the Chinese Empire. Valambrator Daiq personal does not control the army, nor in his advisers, armies and commander of a traitor is a person who ignited the war across the empire for some reason (Starafoh with the passage of events). And the rest of the factions united with some of the good leader to defeat the oppressor and the protection of the people. Thank you to my friend, are important to the gamer man that he is one of the Btenbihi for this film wonderful story and a strong plot itself is a very good screenwriter. May reflect the injustice under which the peoples and Alanhaiip useless wars fueled by some of the less followed them sick. How to make the same coalition with people of different personalities and tendencies and minds, success is how to create an alliance between the (angry volcano, and the slave butterfly, and smart Kaltalb). The film contains many meanings of the noble, and confirms the meaning of it has to be sound thinking and calm nerves to make fateful decisions in a timely manner. May be defective film is a production of China itself, where the movies do not expect strong influences such as Troy and others, but a unique experience of the Chinese cinema influences we consider to be very good.
