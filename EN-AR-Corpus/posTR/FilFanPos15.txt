Call Me in the day that it decided to watch the movie "Please Call Me" I expected to see one of the issues or general problems afflicting the Egyptian society, as it used to film director Khaled Youssef in his films Artkazh on those issues such as slum and suffering and persecution of the security men of the people and the greed of government hospitals and other issues! I did not expect to be the movie "Please Call Me" Comedy, as shown in the Declaration on the channels of various space before the start of his presentation, but I was surprised to reverse this completely, the film has the comedy did not receive any kind of "political comedy or black" in only one of the scenes that he did not notice, Noor Aziz they see and talk On the problem of "bread" in the bakery-governmental organizations, and I think that it has not been given the right to show it. I tried very hard to find words to describe the sense that I felt at the premiere of the film, but I did not find only that the movie "blood light" is nothing more than this, I did not find what critical in the performance of his heroes, has managed to elements of the performance of their roles technology and professionalism, despite the some sexual connotation, which is essential in the dialogue of the film. Faq R. R. Ath what my surprise that director Khaled Yousef in connexion Dialogue before the film said that the film "Please Call Me," talks about a new variable i metamaterials event in the lives of the Egyptians in the last twenty years, a w Orp communications, including Internet, mobile and satellite channels, and this forest complex of communication I think it's Ath rate on the human behavior of the Egyptian society , especially T Bugs center Z and simple E in it, and the film you read less of this variable is negatively or positively to the value system that belongs Egyptian society?. Expected from dialogue Khaled Youssef to see what may It saw the scenes of the problems that corresponding day in the w Orp communications and new technology, but for a moment stopped the idea and I said why you might It saw Joseph problems in that case and the film's producer is one of the most important men w Orp Communications in Egypt businessman Naguib Sawiris?!, I left this question until the start of the film, which dealt with the Tot T T Bugs various communications and the use of some of them in the monument. I became focused on the performance of action heroes, which I did not see in the performance of any kind of default or vexatiousness which may draw the attention of critics, regardless of the sexual titillation that flooded the film, which accustomed the public in the film by Khaled Youssef, and has become something to be him in his films. I was surprised in the last scene of the film slowly to him, "Ibrahim Toshka" embodied Amr Abdel-Galil It's the condition of the car E "Box" after his arrest, he says to his mother: "If my partner Naguib Sawiris Contact Colilh I have to get out what can I do with him production company Sninaii directed by Khaled Youssef and the production of full Abu Ali," Then I remembered immediately movies, Ahmed and Mohamed Subki who are notorious in the recent period their appearance in their films just to say names are in the events of the film. On the other hand predicted that the return of star Shwikar to a movie role is to appear well-deserved, but I have seen only a woman suffering from her son's thinking superficial district and the many problems, there have been Shwikar in the role did not deserve all the uproar that occurred v before filming began to return to the cinema , making it possible to play this role any of the Almmt Latt who Achthern in the role of the mother, which suffer from problems of her sons. The real surprise in the film that I did not expect is a young artist Dalia Ibrahim, which disappeared for a period of very large cinema, w m appeared in the film, this role has as much to give the impression of a large S words and nationality, and some things secret to the girls, did not expect it to provide such a role, especially the scene with ducks collected for the film "Ibrahim Toshka", which tries to seclusion, and the back of this scene in the Declaration of the movie on all the satellite channels. Throughout the film I always wonder when will the artist Maged El Masry, so I was surprised by only two scenes in the latest film is the sequel to "Salah battles" bully his criminal record and an interview out of prison. He also drew my face the new fairy, which embodied the role of "the dawn of a" brother "Ashjan," which embodies the artist Ghada Abdel Razek and the extent of similarities between them, and did not land on the role perfectly for some scenes and suggestions used by the "dawn" of the monument to some young people on the internet, but its performance analog was well. I noticed also the new face Shady Srour in the value of the role of "Atef" Owner central, where he showed the extent of malice and hatred of each of the closer of "a living", as well as changing its course to help "Toshka" to retrieve his son after the kidnapping, "Salah battles" to him. At the end of it I think that the director Khaled Youssef has managed to produce the first film comedy hero Amr Abdel-Galil, and techniques for the film in terms of sound, photography and editing by as much as I know quite a bit, did not draw any theoretical error of even a normal viewer.
