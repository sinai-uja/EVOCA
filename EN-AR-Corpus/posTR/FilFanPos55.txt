Cut and paste "of human life, a large piece consists of pieces of cut and affixed to small items that are not complete" This is the main idea and successfully made by the distinguished director Hala Khalil in her new film "Cut and glutinous." The game of "cut and affixed", which was played by me to work ducks Sheriff Mounir - Yusuf - Fathy Abdel Wahab - Sami - the two go on the streets of downtown depends essentially on vocals Audio is full and we pick up the ends of the crew penchant for the beginnings of new songs in the picture and clarified by author and film director like when they were young Egyptian, who enters in many repeated attempts to escape from their problems and build a life integrated during the many attempts in the trends of bushy lira. In this context, lived "beautiful" heroine of the film work in many professions, "I sell and Bstrae any need to win in the other," they were not working in a specific profession, like that of "Joseph" Graduate School of Business, which operates in one of the maintenance centers and the installation of reception "shower", which is trying to get out of the life of his older brother to be able to "Yahya" the exercise of his life normally. Meet beautiful and Joseph in the working conditions of similar girls succeed when the "girl market" in the completion of its mission and shame, but Joseph and his pacifism does not Essandah in his mission, to bring together their story from the common struggle in these difficult circumstances. Develop this story to view the marriage "my pictures" to offer a beautiful Yosef succeed in escaping from their problems and to migrate to New Zealand, but it was not the picture that Itejellagha especially with the desire of the mother of a beautiful - Sawsan Badr - to live in her daughter - despite their differences, permanent - life as long as hoped is to live. May be reluctant at first to see the film for you and for the first time you will see the Sheriff Mounir is the star of the box, or because the film is not consistent with the wave of comedy current, or because the work provides the reality of Egyptian youth in all its forms painful, but all of these points were in favor of the movie more than they are against him ! The work I wrote the story and dialogue, the director Hala Khalil, as far as he carries the stories of dramatic reality of Egyptian youth, as much as you download from the spirit of humor, and their ways different to accept the reality that obtained in spite of you laughter of humor may not fit with the positions presented on the screen . At the outset faq T have won admiration in this work with you and the first time you will see the decorations are different, not like those consumed in the drama and the Egyptian cinema over the decades past, homes, although a simple e, but new to the viewer's eye, you do not choose halo narrow streets and walls cracked did not imagine the scenes in the stretch and more generally the same places, but T. Kitt Search Lira to find in the end enlist in one of the streets, which includes homes similar to those that stand tall despite the passage of time in the streets "Shubra", and stretch more general simple e suit and the state of youth, who tells his story. As soon as what you see Hanan Turk without her hijab feel nostalgic for the follow-up this child rogue that work hard and struggle, but the performance of tenderness - as we used them all the time - soon forget the veil to focus on the role they done good when filming the role of the young with a hard crust that hides behind women's vulnerability Permanent Walid and the need for caring Tenseeha cruelty of time. The Sheriff Mounir then he deserves a well-deserved title of "star box", is presented in a comedy drama in the first place, but at the same time maintained the cases of minor glitches that disconcerting scenes which imagines the same place many of the heroes of the film. As Fathi Abdel Wahab or "Sami" close friend and neighbor, "Joseph," which represents for Release bakacad utensils of the Egyptian youth is a graduate of the Faculty of Agriculture, a young man daring , Have all missed by his close friend of Iqbal and attention and even disregard for life itself, can not find them just sitting on street corners, all his dreams are limited to getting the right amount of "Banjo" to make him forget the concerns, and satellite channels to provide for the eyes and imagination what is forbidden to him on the ground Indeed, Wal A change completely in one of the ten hours after finding his dream girl, "Zainab", it was like that at first glance the role by Abdul Wahab in one of a his first of the Egyptian Cinema "film w Agafi," but he managed with skill and accuracy in the development of the fine line that separation between the roles of the almost forgotten in moments of the Abd al-Wahhab in the film and replace it with a general acquaintances or friends. "All My Life asceticism in this world and the consent of Bali Ptdeholi," and "I was satisfied with my life .. more where and B_d VIA" This is the main scene in the film, which brought together between the two friends Joseph and Sami Icila in the end and wonder for many "if the youth Cairo they will end up like Amal If youth Territories Hikone factor in what way? " Leaving the answer to the conscience of the viewer. Not the role of "Zainab" is the first action film star young Marwa Mehran general assessment: 4
