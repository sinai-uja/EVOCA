Birds of the Nile Symphony wonderful the Bazvha heroes of the film led by director Magdi Ahmed Ali shows us the good work "Birds of the Nile" With this innovation, in spite of the differing views of many about the film and criticism of the film, the majority agreed on the excellent performance of the representatives, and recognized the beauty of the story and the script and the output. I will not talk About the negatives or the criticism directed at the film, Opinions bushy pounds and criticism also bushy pounds, and I'm already in favor of some criticisms that Jhat of the film, but Roeti to work to these criticisms, although her health has served already work context cinematic, may be the B_iti scenes a bit, but Astt Acts director brilliantly Almmt Lin also resulted in impressive that make a sort of equilibrium, which make the spectator think faq t - without feeling bored - about what she and the content of the film, discovers that the content is such a large segment of the "marginalized" the Egyptian people, who live on their own, away from any care or service, an official from the state, live and die without the feel of their one, or help them in solving their problems. Was able to film Bibhar severe that sheds light on this class, and how is it going now and how it was forty years ago or more by the characters in the work that was contemporary to this period of time, and what is the way it treats the system with this class during these years. Quite liked the story of the film and the skill of the writer "Ibrahim Aslan," And also the outstanding performance of the star Fathi Abdel Wahab, who could already feel the public Bbdaiip person villager who moved to live in Cairo, who was unable, despite the long period that he lived in Cairo that controls the primitive instincts as a man in front of the ladies who know them, The strong return to Abir Sabri, and also conceptual music that accompanied the events of cinematic work was already more than impressive and was able to outline the events endured Senymaiip. Impressed and also on behalf of the film, which may have some different opinion is that the name did not reflect the events Film, but after seeing the film discovered the strong relationship between the name and the film, In the name of the message he wants to present the film, Valasfor is the object weak Livni, his life only in the search each morning for i in him and his younger sons or endeavor to build a nest of small for him and their young to protect them, and if someone tries to A help assistance is provided by him is that someone incarcerating him in a cage Lait uncle. If we put this context the events of the film is clear to us that the writer is talking about people who have the same attributes, In reality, many people with these qualities are class marginalized from the community addressed by the writer and director in the film without drawing attention to the letter the fact that he is talking about, Fdart events on the small number of people, and talked the film is already a lot of problems, but did not discuss Mcklha particular was monitored layer of the community live and die in turn have one to help them. And vice versa may consider them, the system sometimes as T bug that secrete always corrupt elements Almt pounds of the people, and whatever this view which is seen by these T bug, Astt Acts movie, despite the atmosphere of sadness and desires Ct consequences on most of the film, that highlights Aladwae Ali Some elements of sound that you want to benefit the community and try to change a little bit of problems, and we see this Almt For the young Abdullah Yahya poor lives. And tries to change some of the negatives surrounding the system, despite opposition to him and trying to "Abdullah" to do any positive role in society, but this role he considered the role opposite or counter him, the fight is started and supported. I rely film technology flashback in the narrative of the facts of the events, and film shows to try to strengthen the direction given to reduce the power of another direction and make a kind of balance of power, which is what happened in Egypt when the payment was made with the Muslim Brotherhood in the era of President Sadat to reduce the prevalence of left-wing Communist .
