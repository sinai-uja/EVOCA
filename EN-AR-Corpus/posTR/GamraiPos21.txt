21 - Movie Name: Wuthering Heights Rating: 7 / 10 when you see my name is Ralph Wiens and Juliette Binoche on the poster did what, Watching the film has become something obvious, I am in this situation, I would be satisfied with the minimum of comfort movies that become existence guaranteed the presence of these two names, even if the elements of the film remaining is still inferior to the quality of their performance, in the film is adapted from a novel of English literature, "Heights and Zaring," led by the Vines, and Binoche Chksitaha main ably we used it, but the director ,, intentionally or not, about the characters of the novel paper, To the style theater, or to say that it has failed to transform the situation literary novel for the case of film, seeming dialogues film, Mlguenp, and review, but not the chemistry Bank between characters, the film the two main "Kathy and Hizqlv" for the film became boring to a large degree, Fortunately Binoche and Vines are among the representatives of the few who sings expressions of their faces and enable highly of the performance of the dramatic situation, for the script of the film in full, especially given that the scenario addressed in only, and does not address all else, and this I think is a problem film major, Vafilm who talks about the three generations of two families, the story revolved around the main heroes, Lose film appalled epic and turned to film romantic, with representatives empowered, Vafilm depicts situations change big three entire generations, the film refers to the occurrence of such changes without knowing how it happened, and here I wonder, how, if there is a draft of this film with my own hands Out Kstanley Kubrick, I wonder how he will come out of the great transformations that have occurred in those families, I remember very well, The handling of these transformations on the character Edmund Barry, in his film Barry Lyndon, but unfortunately in the film Peter Kulunsky this, has been sidelined completely, and the acceleration of events without a solid ground I am a bored and boredom, in many periods of the film, and lost part a large force of Btalah drama, I've never read the novel, I do not know whether the novel has surrounded these developments and changes that have occurred to this family, but I see no need to adhere to the literal text literary that were not those changes may have been taken into account which, is more important in my opinion, is the coherence of the screenplay excerpt, and this in my opinion, completely missing here wonderful music for the film was made, but I find that method employed was bad, And lack of presence in the important shots lose it luster and shipped emotional, actually Fortunately, the hero and the film are Wiens Binoche, because I am guaranteed a minimum of existential fun movie.
