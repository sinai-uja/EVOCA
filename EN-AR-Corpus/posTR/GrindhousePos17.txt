Name of the movie: Lions For Lambs more films that have suffered from negative criticism this year, both from critics or the public in terms of what to take a look at the cast film expecting to see great films at the very least, but the equation has not been completed here, the causes of vulnerability is the fact that Movie political discussion punctuated by dramatic way many moments of boredom, Viewers want to see my films and Redford is not a boring lecture in the Faculty of Law! , The second reason that Tom Cruise starring in the film, I do not see never in the place of Senator or the person who stands with George Bush to portray him, as though the frustration of seeing Tom Cruise in this role that did not come out recently about the scope of action films and love stories, This is what you expect of others tuned for the film by seeing his picture on the cover, and I hope this issue will not be repeated next year when the film opens Falcri war, in addition to that, the movie mentally tired! Well talk is a wonderful and meaningful and intelligent, but he is very fast, if you nodded your head a little on the screen you will find yourself lost in the next quarter of an hour, and as a cultural lecture already Finally we come to a point of vulnerability most important and is the neglect of Robert Redford, the artistic side in the film, it lacked the film, unfortunately, to this aspect, there is an archaeological technician come out of the movie, just the information and discussions and aftertreatment in speech and praised and vilified in America and finally, On the other hand had the film has many positives, which rushed out of the scope of the "bad film", Of course, at first I will mention the name of Merle Strel, more a human being on earth was nominated for an Oscar, a prominent role and coherent as usual, on the other hand the role of a normal Tom Cruise, Robert Redford, and of beautiful things in the script is doing to whiten the eyes of viewers to many of the wrong decisions by the U.S. recently, And connected by a deep and meaningful discussions are accompanied throughout the film, in the end a good movie, will see mostly boring to a large degree, and they see little fun and meaningful, but in the end did not reach the level of expectations at all.
