Movie Name: Facing Ali - 2009 did a wonderful and exciting right, tells the story of the rise of months boxers on the face of the earth, but the best athlete of the twentieth century as he was crowned in 1999, Muhammad Ali, who won the world heavyweight boxing three times in a row. Deals with the film story of the hero myth in an enjoyable and interesting of all aspects of his eventful history, until the start of the stage of the demise of star, as a result of injuries sustained during games of 61 played, and won in 56 of them, and 37 of his victories were by knockout! What distinguishes the film in my opinion is that it is not just a documentary, but not a narrative - a wonderful narrative, narrated by real people lived through the Muhammad Ali, where they were simply professional boxers won some international titles and defeated Muhammad Ali himself. Boxing champions, including heavyweight like George Foreman, Joe Frazier, one of them where crying during his account of the details of his life, which overlapped with the life of Muhammad Ali "the greatest". The film has been lined up to take him out, despite the simplicity of imaging techniques, but it Ilsqk Getty seat in the last moment in the film. After each section showing a part of the interview in which tells a professional boxing world for his personal experience and response to Muhammad Ali, and how it reflected on his life, we see live footage of historic match which brought the spokesman with Clay, to reflect the greatness of this boxer and abilities Deals in boxing, which he named is the "Fly like a butterfly, such as Alas Bee" ("Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. "), which reflect the style feat in boxing, which is built on superior agility in the movement butterfly, and punched a quick and sudden, such as bee sting, which included dropping the most notorious and powerful boxers. The film shows rare footage of Muhammad Ali Clay before each match, where he intended to make fun of his opponents very discourteous to destroy them morally and in television interviews were conducted with him. I strongly recommend watching this movie, which depicts the life of the ducks for the duck which was also not in the eyes of the American people who saw it as a black "greatest", a symbol of defiance and steadfastness and victory, where Muhammad Ali, who converted to Islam has refused to participate in the Vietnam War, and proclaimed the rights of blacks joined the movement "the Nation of Islam" that has emerged, including Malcolm X and Iljugih Mohammed, was considered already Icon greatness and superiority, and freedom from slavery and racial oppression ...
