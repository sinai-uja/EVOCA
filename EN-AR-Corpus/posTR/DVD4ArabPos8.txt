 8 - Movie Name: INK Rating: 8.5/10 What do you do if you knew that a dream is made by angelic beings would like to spread goodness and love?! And what would be your reaction if I realized that the bad guys nightmares under the responsibility to spread devastation and hatred at night every day?! Do you see the day came when the girl's desperate Osookwabesha Emma turns to a reality in front of her? Senqzha from and how and why and how will the circumstances? I think it's a philosophical film from first-class, which is not accustomed to such as films and Vhemenaha well, To be a good business mind and focus while watching the film to link things together and grasp the hidden meanings behind the scenes and dialogues. The film is not suitable for viewers who want a quick boring cinematic meal ready to get it back quickly and give backs. Movie deep meanings and good, but he invites you to the patience of even possible to bring him back more than once to understand well.
