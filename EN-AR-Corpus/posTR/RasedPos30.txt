Movie Name: Harry Brown - 2009 was very fun to watch Harry Brown, despite the simplicity of his story. The reason is that the events of the film is expected .. Almost. The film speaks about Harry Brown, played by the famous British actor and Oscar winner Michael Caine. Aging Harry Brown and his wife when she dies in the hospital. It remains for him in this world but his friend Leonard, who was serving with him for long hours in front of the chess table. But days after the shocking death of his wife the news of the death of Leonard, who had told him that there are people who are exposed to. Open investigations into police offices to find out the murderer, had been arrested, some of the boys suspected of involvement in the crime. But it soon be released because of lack of evidence .. Harry Brown here decides to take the law with his own hands and take revenge for his friend, to begin a series of dramatic events that have championed this old man, which is difficult to believe that he can do what he would do! I did not like at all personal unrealized police (played by Emily Mortimer) as they seemed to represent the abyss of an actress in the Egyptian cinema. There is something in her face made me Enver them .. I do not know what is .. Simply hated to see it. Can say that the movie instead of that story Mgbaderip interesting, is the criticism of the police, where they arrested the suspects and released them without delay .. What intrigued me also raised is that these suspects, Kano during the investigation wielding, a barrage of insults to achieving these, and her colleague, and they do not move a finger .. Kano, but they explicitly threaten to kill the investigators and stomping on them .. I do not know British law allows you to do that? I invite all Rating: 8 / 10
