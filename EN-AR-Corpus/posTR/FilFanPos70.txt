One of the people, "Do you think de need Tafrhani O pilgrim?" That sentence spoken hero of the movie in response to the words of his father that his son, "See you", but did not pass like unnoticed Ali, because it is an embodiment of the tragedy of the film's hero, What is new in the film Belal Fadl not plot revenge, or playing with adults, or corruption of the police. . It is this confusion which the violation occurred, "Mahmoud," the hero finds himself obliged to implement the error, or find his mother, a steal and turned his life a living hell. Sentence that reflects the rejection of Mahmoud what it is, and refuses to grow up his son does not become "footmen known Eachd right of this world, and Maindharbc the scruff of his neck," she puzzled similar confusion Farid Shawki in the film "made me a criminal" and confusion Nur al-Sharif in "the strongest men," but that Mahmoud did not turn, remained the same, however, did more than his counterparts. And that picture that he wanted to grace, and Ahmed Galal provide Mahmoud of which, a man lost, he entered the Faculty of Social Work was suspended in Allatbakp, and married a girl imitating, most dreams to change the curtains home and go to the Fayoum, oscillating between the wishes of his family poor, and rejection of the haram, and incidence in Fajh . The feelings of many, was full of personal Mahmoud, but the star Kareem Abdul-Aziz, was found in front of a barrier to prevent access to the deep, between these contradictions, the excellent performance of Abdul Aziz lightly blood as usual, may have been intentionally dye Mahmoud such, but of course, would circle is at the top of confusion and hand extends to the wealth that is forbidden by his pregnant wife to take to the doctor, or he faces his wife's killers face to face. In those scenes were wink the eye, or Iimet top of the cream enough to get out the scenes of psychological climate of the scene drama to show some smiles, as if the trio "Bilal - Abdul Aziz - Jalal" which provided "Abu Ali" not safe for the drama in all regions, just as Aziz did not feel safe Holiday to the picture that appeared in the first half of the film and even his release from prison. In the first half appeared mature cream without toxic and rich young man, or Hqaop son of the country, try as much as Almstt makers to make us see the life of Mahmoud monotonous happy poor, but Abdel-Aziz's just that the young man returned to the image bakacad Irrigation, and perhaps stay in one house with a girl by Menna Shalabi helped him in his first mission, as it made its full combinations, yes, did not provide new, but remained at their level, and went live with scenes of her husband's confusion, and fear it honest. Excelled in the virtue of making personal Mahmoud, between the extreme reluctance and inability to make a decision, and the rapid rush angry when under pressure , Which conceals preferred to quietly after the departure of ducks for the prison, without falling into the trap of Altt Lowell because of the scenes justificatory of how the shift in personality, or how the acquisition of the qualities and knowledge is new to him, but only with reference to all this i sell me a young university, the work to guard the garage, and suddenly found himself the center of "whale country." Elements of corruption in the film Jalal were centers of power, especially with the skilled Ezzat Abu Ouf, but the surprise was in Mohammed Shoman, Astt Acts coloring his voice according to each scene, and his looks - and that has not changed - was sharp and expressive about how much of corruption record of it, and the tension in a scene captured it was good, but Ahmed's salary did not feel it, the same performance of the great artist, and a lack of interest by virtue of, and Bilal to Give Loyalty to a larger area. On the other hand, was the "good" less compromise, Vchksip press Dalia were not central to the events and does not influence them, and the artist Mahmoud soldier did not find in the role of confirming his return, unless the previous scene to go Mahmoud to the court, which shook the feelings of the viewer to Min crying, and he sees the father is unable to instruct his son to be correct because of helplessness and powerlessness both handcuffed. Soundtrack Amr Ismail was more than impressive, especially in the scenes of bombings, fight, and formed a bilateral with a wonderful director of photography Ihab Mohamed Ali, the Pacific servers montage of Maha Rushdie, which was very good in the scenes of "flashback." Jalal interesting element of make-up earn the viewer's credibility is high, and allowed the camera to move closer to the faces of representatives, without fear, Vhevca Mona Alzarkohtan after the murder, and injuries after Mahmoud succeeds in prison was very good. Left to point to full cooperation between the preferred and Jalal, albeit a new kind of virtue as he said in more than one occasion been the most important thing in the film for him to show the drama of uncertainty of a natural person of the people simple a view of corruption surrounding him from every side, while Jalal was " Action "element wants to offer a new image, which is what has for both, but each separately. In the first half feet preferred what he wants from a loss of all her servants Jalal elements, but not including Kareem Abdul-Aziz, and in half <User Rating: 4
