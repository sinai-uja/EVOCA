Natural colors when I decided to watch the movie "natural colors" I expected a movie the way movies Hani Fawzi, but it is different this time, with the first scenes in the film, as soon as the young artist Karim Kassem, he wondered to himself about Halal and Haram, contradictions and conflicts inside about the eligibility of act of "The Right or wrong" Attracted the dialogue written by the author Hani Fawzi, especially the scenes that brought action heroes inside the walls of the Faculty of Fine Arts, and the emergence of many different streams within the college, including the religious, political, moral and trimmer and Alousoli and authoritarian and the beggar and others, and more What I liked faculty members beginning from the dean of the college to Teaching Assistant in a smaller college. For the first time in my life hit a state of disgust and fascination at the same time, during the scene collecting three streams within one of the halls College, one of them dancing on the song foreign, and the other is dancing on a popular song, and is a T Huelva religious people call the prayer, and a T Lab invited the Orthodox Christians to worship, in spite of my admiration for this great scene, but I Oattab the director and the author in this scene specifically. The Antbatne a state of disgust when focused director in one of its the "middle" student dance, and another beside it says "God is great God is great I bear witness that no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of God" and completes the call to prayer, and I think that the author Hani Fawzi, director Osama Fawzi Issehajman by the press, media and critics on this scene. Regardless of some of the scenes that have been dominated by Archaeological Ball of nationality between the armpit of the work, after the first few minutes of the film, especially among Farah Youssef, Ramzi Lennart and easier Lozi Karim Qasim, I do not consider this a measure of the success of the film or the fall of H, probably wanted the director and producer of these scenes to raise the proportion of seen the film, especially as we all know that this generation of young people looking for those scenes in Egyptian movies. And those scenes not Aaaraa any attention, because the scenario and dialogue pulled me, as well as imaging, Particle Physics Director of Photography Tariq Tlemceni, and more what I loved also in the film songs music Yasmine Hamdan, provided by the wallpapers of the events, as well as the band "Black Thema" who appeared in a concert college. I Chglny events and the follow-up performance Almmt Lin, it was dazzled by symbolic enlightened, as well as Ibrahim Salah, but I did not expect this great performance by Karim Kassem, especially after his role in the movie "Magic", as well as Farah Yusuf, The El Youssef easier Lozi I think that the performance of the two was very good for the role, and succeeded in my attention to check with the artist's father, Mahmoud Yousra Lozi Lozi has Ocarni that "Albonbonp" Btaat Board of Directors of the College. And the end Like the internal conflict of the film's hero who embodied Karim Qassem, between right and wrong and between heaven and hell and perspective for them, a case of a young Egyptian man tries to walk straight or deviates, it becomes suspended in the middle, "the Lahu collector deviant or collector respectable." I wish to see young people actually work, because many will like, "and come to the scenes who kept them Qltlkua Gamadoa Aenkm, and nobody ventured Bmozp Btaath and go, as they may emerge from the cinema Taatnaqb."
