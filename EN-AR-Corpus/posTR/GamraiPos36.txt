 36 - Movie Name: Erin Brockovich Rating: 9 / 10 Do you know who is the hero in films Steven Soderbergh, they are yellow and blue colors, on the night of the Oscars in 2001, In my opinion, was Soderberg is the star of that night Petrchihan Statue of best director, for congestion and Erin Brockovich, which is not preceded by only Oliver Stone in 86, the statue of the best text 'Salvador and Platon',, I deeply respect this director and I appreciate his work, In addition to that it stores a lot of 'cinema', and contains a unique directorial look solid and the texts and performances are excellent, It is way out of the directors of the few who offer their project intellectual style film, and this is what we saw in the Traffic and Erin Brockovich, detective and other experiences of this director and talented, Erin Brockovich, and I think that the name Eastern European significance in the film Soderberg this, because it is loosely based on real events ,, a girl may seem at first glance, a prostitute, but from the standpoint of Soderberg, Bitch made to society and to itself unless the agencies, human rights presented to the owners of the rights in the same community, although it is not a whore at the same time that are not there until a lawyer, and is proud of this, and after watching the film, I think that all viewers Sifajron them. Soderberg commented on several points, first, that women can, to do everything, in one case, That was supported by a man, the second point which I consider was treated in a professional manner excellent, a lack of trust between the affected people, and those rights which are supposed to get them their rights, Erin Brockovich, here was a link between the two sides will keep the male, , the problem of those agencies, human rights, it deals with the affected clients, And deal with issues as cases, while Irene, as part of the class affected, she believes that the first step in solving the problem is felt, is the sense of the damage resulting therefrom, is gaining the confidence of the victim by giving hope to find a solution, which by Irene persevered, and proved itself through this work prior to substantiate her theory, Julia Roberts, Erin Brockovich was really, Was all it could be Erin Brockovich him, we knew the same Koerin deserves a great actress for this role, all the appreciation deserved Oscarha no doubt,
