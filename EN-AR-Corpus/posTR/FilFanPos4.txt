Love is in the film interesting and different from the comedy now prevailing in the "market", although it is the first film of director Saad al-Hindawi, which of course Sishva the presence of some lapses or errors in the film, but as we mentioned it a different movie and new. In terms of output, the Hindawi deal with the possibilities that exist between his hands a great understanding, accommodated the beginning of the story and script writer Ahmed Abdel-Fattah, to his ability to lead six Youth representatives efficiently, and fell to the slightest mistake is simple, we give an example of a scene singer sword when he sees the Rim for the first time, perception and the impression that initial scene Aiouhi as the first time from the ground up, and then scenes of fantasy sword he imagined himself singing to his beloved "anonymous" was weak, did not express and is attractive enough, but it passed off peacefully. For the story and scenario and dialogue as I said back absorb the director Hindawi them so out the film carries a "story" already and not only so, but is the story and then pounds and coherent e and bear a number of topics, but it turned out the "cause" is also important, there may be irony in my style, but not on the film, but because of the exclamation point is there then for this film, which carries the i Agencies all films between "market" characterized by "Balbohemep" clear. Camera photographer Nizar Shaker was full of movement and vitality, and understanding of scenario, whether in rapid chases footage or footage in lively discussions between the family inside the house. For represented Yale, Hani Salama, the afternoon performance of Mature this time, Hind Sabri, was the other understanding significantly the character of Habiba to feel that they were performed with love and "mood", while the Sheriff Ramzy While he is the second of his films after "the secrets of girls," but that there is a big difference and a clear distinction between his performances in films , it was his appearance here faq t mature and fun, as it was represented Night master and shows the talent this young man, and Tamer Hosni in his first performance was automatically acceptable to a large extent, thus the public to attend the reception stretch represented the Lord's new in the world of cinema, and Almmt Him low in this role was different is the other of her previous roles, and played convincingly make the audience hate her because of its presence as a symbol for America and its actions despicable and corrupt, can not overlook the role of Maha Abu Ouf performance outstanding, including bear and her expressions of simple e f Mwt Rh with features comfortable soft, either pet find that it was the performance of a less-convincing and, where It was carrying expressions Ronevi live on her face most of the time, although it is not the first time in the cinema, where she developed by in front of a giant cinema Ahmed Zaki in the movie "Fear Factor," but it was clear they did not benefit from this experience, and appear to perform weak next to the others. My comment on the make-up that it was appropriate most of the time, but I have a problem in accepting the make-up which appeared by the minimum in a scene and arrival at the airport, it was make-up rude inappropriate her face, but may be un-dramatically, I do not know if there is a purpose in the same way out of this snapshot, you may have the purpose of art, or a goal, but I unfortunately have not assimilated. Editor Mona Spring was unique in this movie, fast enough, has shown me is a mature performance in the other as they moved from film to last through the last period was the last of this film and the film "Abu Ali". In the end I say that, despite the fact that the film is the first directorial experience to Saad Hindawi in feature films, but he has proven the existence of new talent with determination to put their own imprint in the history of Egyptian cinema.
