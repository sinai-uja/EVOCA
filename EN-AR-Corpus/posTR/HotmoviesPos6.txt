Alice in Wonderland wrote: Mohammed al-Masri Rating: 3.5 out of 5 Starring: Mia and Azcoka, Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Haitawai Director: Tim Burton (2010) is difficult to say for example that Tim Burton had lost his way, but - at least for me - did not achieve much waiting for him .. Has always been "Alice" emerging from Lewis Carroll's masterpiece of an essential part of most fantasy films King in Hollywood, and even participated in the work only in written or inspired by the poems .. Alice is always there, so the provision of the novel on the screen to see a private deserves to be called "a lifetime project," and wonders if the country had been achieved through a visually wonderful .. It is disturbing that the literary value and humanity of the story has received in other Burton films, which touched me a lot more here .. The problem with this film, in my view that Burton has failed to give (T Aba epic) of what is happening, there is a severe shortage in the value of drama and failed to play on the tendons that immortalized the story over time, she pulled me is yes, but without a genuine interest in what happens within them, I did not care bushy Lira trip Alice did not worry about the fate did not interact with its world fantasy, something does not happen only because of a bad choice and Mia Azcoka to perform Alice and the apathy of attractive Johnny Depp this time .. But, because Burton has often strayed from the spirit of the novel and was adopted at other times we preserve the events by heart and left many details dumped intuitively .. Preferred seconds On the positive side, there is overwhelming presence of Helena Bonham Carter in the role of the "Red Queen" is a movie in my opinion, the real attraction of the degree to which affect the rhythm in the scenes of the deserted and makes good rival, "Anne Hathaway" looks quite pale so! , There is a unique visual experience and the world is close to the childhood memory strongly and special attention to the details of iconic personalities, there is a popular music style to Danny Elfman, and there are seen during a real pleasure, even if you did not leave anything beyond .. But the outline, and relative to the size of the queue, and compared as a "draft age" who waited for two decades implemented, I am disappointed by far!
