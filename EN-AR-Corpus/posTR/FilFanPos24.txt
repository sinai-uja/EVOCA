King Kong seems to be the failure of American film heroes such as "Rambo" and "Commando" and "James Bond" and "Super Man" to prevent the September attacks against the United States of America prompted the filmmakers to create characters unbelievable amounts of capacity in order to "intimidate" enemies, and to convince the American people that what happened in 2001 can not be repeated again! This can be understood from behind the lines in the movie "King Kong" Amazing that I saw recently, away from the scenes of horror and dismay, excitement and adventure that will attract both children and adults. The film, which has slowly Lth and Naomi Watts, Jack Black film clearly reflects what has reached the computer technology and techniques of cinematic tricks in the world of Hollywood fantasy, but this does not mean that there are brilliant again we have seen in the film before it opened our eyes and our mouths in disbelief to what we see, whether Of filmed and directed and decorations, to the extent that it can be said that his Oscar-winning director Steven Spielberg's blockbuster "Jurassic Park - Part I" was backward compared to the contribution made by director King Kong, but that the word "decorative" in the movie "King Kong" looks very small compared with selling T scenery we saw on the island of "skull", the island in which they are most of the film. And an increase in "complexity", insisted the director on the film revolves in the early twentieth century, and not in the present era, which made him have to make decorations for the entire city streets and fields and Sinmadtha and suburbs and cars, Vcarna already that we are living in 1920 and then not, the issue is not a review, But if we thought then Why did not the film makers of this story at this age and not in the present era, we find that the current era will not fit the story, because the animal's ferocious and then King Kong easily eliminate By rockets and guided missiles, laser and cluster bombs, etc., can also be "booby-trapping" the entire island mine or hit with nuclear weapons or biological or chemical, all day, and Tlakic by sex creature, not dinosaurs and King Kong and insects giant disgusting and alien Athva the director of the film ! I will not be the omission of what happened At the end of the film when he was killed monster King Kong to show the director of selfish staff is answering questions from journalists and say what can be considered the wisdom of the movie is "It's beauty that killed the beast," and we make it a faq t and pronounced: "It is love that killed the beast," fall of the King Kong in love with a girl who is sent down from the perch, which is implicated E in many battles and problems, who got him into families, which made him leave home and place of strength, which made him climb on top of Nat fairway in order to review the magnitude of the clouds so! This is the meaning that can be understood by adults of the film, which of course, unlike many other meanings that can be absorbed by the young, such as "Love Animals" and "Radar" and "compassion" and "courage" .. And more! But we take the film on some exaggerations or errors, the first humans who appeared at the beginning of adventure on the island disappeared completely throughout the movie, did not appear to us why have disappeared and where they went, and how to combat the following took place on the island without showing them any effect, why not a know! W Aneha: that no one knows how successful this ship meager leg Actively in the withdrawal of this creature's giant sea water all the way to be displayed in the theater, and the other question, how was the transfer of King Kong in a box or cage is closed and then not to the theater in the city center, it is not a villa then no or a lion, but a creature its size the size of high-rise building, and the question Alokt R. importance is: Where is security? And how it allowed the Salt s then do not submit such a monster on the scene in the middle of City in the presence of viewers, which is known to be the minimum possible break i Lebaa?!! And the third is this: that after King Kong's rampage through the streets of the city, and found some pedestrians routinely walk in the streets and squares, as if nothing had happened! But, excuse me, I find myself I am ashamed to make any comments on a film like this, because I faq t Almstmtain tags, and the effort made over the Bkt Seen any note or negative, it is enough that the vast majority that I saw came out happy to see it even though its duration exceeded three hours, did not get one of the movies to insult religion or curse the makers of the film as seen in other films, and more importantly, the whole movie were not where any cat e nude or hot outside, or even, God Bastt remote kiss unwitnessed e "model" of the last century between him the film Duck and her lover! Finally, the scene of extending a hand of peace, which reiterates the population of the island to the invaders, and then repeats of King Kong's "Ann", might be reflective of the concept of peace, and how you should <User Rating: 4
