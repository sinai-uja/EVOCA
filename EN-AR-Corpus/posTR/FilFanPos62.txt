The Yacoubian Building will not pretend that the furore of media which preceded the introduction of the film in cinemas Egyptian did not Tsbni confused severe, because you are which oscillates between you want real follow-up to a good movie and get a feel that most of these Alehaugat end, "the Mafeesh", as was the case with many films known to many. But when the film began, I found myself having difficulty in keeping my eyes on the display screen, led me to the point at the end of the film to remind myself to breathe from time to time! When you find a film featuring such elite of stars you think that all of them will seek to attract attention to himself, ignoring the real purpose of the submission of this film, but I have found stars senior attract young people to stand all along waiting for words of admiration, respect and appreciation from the public. The story of the film includes many, many stories that we find in our daily lives, moved by Alaa al-Aswani faithfully on paper for the Ist t by the scriptwriter and creative Wahid Hamed, one of the faq R. scenarios quality in the history of Egyptian cinema, where he was able to turn the story which correlate the events of her through many, many relationships, which is dominated by T Aba sexual, more subtle without compromising the quality of the story or the events of her, everyone away from the specter of feeling embarrassed and then for these scenes. But what is impressive is the blending of expertise represented in the scriptwriter much like Hamed, a group of stars bones such as Adel Imam and accessible, and Nur al-Sharif, with skill and professionalism of the happiness of Younis, Khaled Saleh and Khaled Al Sawi and Ahmed Bedier, Ahmad Ratib, and energy of youth represented in the Muhammad Imam and Hind Sabri and toxicity Khashab and Abbas Abu Hassan, the director of a promising, such as Marwan Hamed. And we give up on the leader just before the duck has a narcotic and stretch her Mkasemth Nur al-Sharif with the star did not deprive him of Alant Laq quite strongly in this film, but he apparently removed the lamb w Qila on his shoulders to reach Baltmt Yale into one of the highest degree of creativity, to give up the laughter with the task to amuse them through a personal "Zaki Desouki" I'm Basha, who is deteriorating by the case guided behind the whims and lapses with women, for the surprise leader, the role of dramatic strong tears in his eyes which go to the Lord to pray i Alba forgiveness from him saying: "I am what I am somewhat offended, I Movech is myself!" While I found that Nur al-Sharif in the role of "Mohammad Azam" a man of business, which rose the ladder of success after it was a scanner for shoes is not new, and despite the different details of the line and i e petition similar to a large extent with the role of "Haji" in the soap opera's famous "family-Haj Metwally, "but that Zauge events within the film by" Souad ", which embodied the role of toxicity Khashab fueled this sense of w Bits inside me, but this does not negate the couple's master filmmakers in the roles of each individual. It may be easier for the small role of "Christina" has not added to it, but she saw him, Noor Aziz, The role of the friendly old Zaki Desouki, his first love, which resorted to whenever he feels despair you may be able represented him of any submission, except that the relationship of the strong friendship between Between the two stars, in fact, made this role was something special, as any represented him play such a role be played with skill and professionalism of prohibitively high, but they are not and will not be able to grab this interaction real leader Adel Imam. Will not be able to ignore the good luck and success and who are wonderful in a row according to Khaled El-Sawy his presentation to the role of "Hatem Rashid" editor anomaly, where Encountered based on the film difficult to choose represented by the embodiment and then for this role Emtemt him in fear and an apology many stars for a sponsor, to settle the matter in the end, El Sawy, and will not be exaggerating if I said that this Almmt's who did not get a moment of fame and stardom deserves prize Oscar for his outstanding performance for this character. The new face of Muhammad Imam, He has excelled degree to put on an equal footing with the Stars net from the youth of this generation, not only because it did not take advantage of being the son of a big star such as Adel Imam, but he was able to make the role anything distinct everyone is talking about immediately after the presentation. And abandoned the young star and premiums for him and his father, to confirm for all of the first scene from the movie - where Shows allows him architecture and subjected to a severe insult of a population - it is already unable to reprise the role of Mwt t Kt Alp recessive faced rejection in the admission tests for the Faculty of condition e because his father, "guard the drug" is simple, pay conditions deteriorating and he gave up to join one of the religious groups Almtt Winking and which are the real reason to insult him and torture, which feeds so strong desire for revenge. And always raised the Tunisian star Hind Sabri admiration for the simple attention to detail and hidden, but very important for its role, and language Vmlabsaa general assessment: 4
