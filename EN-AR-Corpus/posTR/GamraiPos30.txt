 30 - Movie Name: The Lovely Bones Rating: 6 / 10 There is a group of directors, you can acquire their films, without you're in doubt about the quality, either won awards or were cut, to your knowledge, that the issue of awards and gaining may be determined by things other than material, film and quality, are the productivity of marketing distributional and the like, for directors like Martin Scorsese, Darren Arnoviski, Clint Aistod, Robert Altman, Roman Polanski, Wim Wonders and many others. After seeing this film, surprised too how did not see this film on some of the nominations, especially for the Award Rizi, and confirmed, that Peter Jackson as a director, not for those who deserve all their films seen, especially those that were cut from the award, I realized , that Jackson of the directors who did not honor their films, because it does not deserve honor, lovely bones, Another cries Fashion Jackson technical, not loose, no breaks and links are not between personalities or between Awalmh ((and especially as it discusses the different worlds)), or between ideas, feel specifically that this film was made, to shorten the concept of Paradise and photographed through the camera or PC Peter Jackson, as well as a set of renderings which I consider the worst of what I saw in 2009. Mark Olberg - Rachel Weisz - Susan Sarendn,,, not Tgrk these names, or Oscaradtha and their nominations earlier, because they were in this movie have the worst they have is, this film gave me another service, other than relying on the name of the director and the names of representatives for the selection of my films , but also gave me advice that, no need to watch the film, to watch the performance, Frank Sirius seemed to play a role in another film, Their performance was a candle film, and the only light in which, along with some pictures three-dimensional of the Commission, imagined with Peter Jackson, an excellent performance despite the square-small, and despite the inability of the text of the weak to give them the foundations for this performance on the other hand the nomination Alauskari obtained by Stanley Toshi, did not sway me, it seemed to me very vulgar and illogical everything, especially his performance, however, and the whole, I think the film worth seeing, is true that the gaps and more disadvantages than its advantages, it is not fun. If I want something that is more than entertainment from this film, scenes singing the last of the film deserves for it to complete the scenes film to end, wherein a bit of the hallmarks of history Peter Jackson Alauskari and epic in the 2003, which it seems, will not be repeated , will have the opportunity to see Peter Jackson's hair bedraggled others pay on the stage of the Kodak anymore, that the Left in this vein.
