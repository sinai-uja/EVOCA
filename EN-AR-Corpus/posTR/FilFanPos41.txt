Embassy in Architecture Scene the end is often the most Sijzbk to review the opinion that I set up after the earlier of the scenes, way out by Amr Arafa drafted tact, because it did not change the course of the character she lived her life between freaks women and drugs suddenly and the body of convincing justification and make him a hero to half of the film, but a shift in personal emotional transformation as a result of a temporary vision of the child who grew up on his hands when he was dying in Palestine. If implemented, the idea of review of the film as we agreed you will find that the relationship between the Sheriff Khairy "Adel Imam" and the Palestinian child, "Iyad" and he learns from Sharif everything, there may be a strong signal to what should be the relationship between the two countries even though the large without a goal!! The author tried Yusuf Mat j to emphasize the popular rejection of the Alqat p Ltt Sale, when coming off Egypt Whenever he spoke with someone spit and alienate him, even Alaft At Rey, who refused to connect the T to become him, and the bitch who refused to accept money from him after learning of its neighbors despite the exaggeration in the scene, and the music was Omar Khayrat associated with the moment of his arrival stretch R. Cairo appropriate to show the feelings of intimacy with and i NH even entered his apartment and looked out the window and found the Israeli flag on his apartment nearby and turned the music to the anxiety and fear. He also tried to just in front as usual, add some things that appear in his films - the latter of which - especially love all the women of the film with it, but Amr Arafa was able this time from the atmosphere and realistic on this love and make it to some extent justified and has a goal in the drama of the film. The film of some strange events, most notably the response of intellectuals of the Progressive Left "communists" during the party for the words of Sheriff naive, that ended with "I Hate Israel," which expressed the extent of elimination suffered Mdeii culture. I will not hide a secret when I say I was very notion of "Alteraiqa" on the poem "No reconciliation," the poet "hope Denkul" but this feeling dissipated when I heard just before a House says, because it is natural evaluate speech as much as the owner Sharif charity, of course, is personal do not even know who is "Kofi Annan," defined by the "Iyad", as he was drugged and left to speak of it laden with the smell of "grass." The transformation drama of the main character was very convincing he did not come as a surprise, but ranging through the character of Dalia Buhairi that change for which he was impressed by the even witness the killing of Palestinian children who completed the change, and it was the most prominent scenes which confirmed his conversion is the lack of attention to a woman a beautiful pass by him after was interested in any woman! After interaction with Dalia actress thought the Communist - which Aevqha Sharif - has filed a lawsuit against its neighbors, "Israeli Embassy" to expel them from the apartment and they filmed in situations of breach of threatening to give up the case, which is a clear signal to the policy of threat followed by Israel with all of the opposers even controlled by the and implement their wishes. It was possible to become Khaled Sarhan, a key figure, but the marginalization was strange, it was not for the character of any axes did not escalate throughout the film, and Dalia Buhairi that changed the skin this season more Almfattin to look in the film, and changed the character girl kind peaceful to the girl strong do not care problems and political orientation. But wrong on the film that was loaded with some of the scenes that Tchaaraa "stuck" without justification, Valdhabt guarding the architecture came to talk to Sharif and assures him he is the best character offset in his life and this was without any previous memory of a good between the parties to make it praises this exaggeration! The scene, which became bis is the irony of the Egyptian media Film and Television government and a special channel "Al Jazeera" news on the "peacock and Alumblyan" in the scene of the case filed by the Sheriff, when he stood at the door of the court reporter for the channel enlightening, which is on the weight of the island, written with the same logo of the channel country, like a laughable because of the emotional movements and automatic way to speak!
