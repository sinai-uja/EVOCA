The Ugly Truth, although I am not convinced of the capabilities of Katherine Higel actress powerful have the capacity to take responsibility for the film "Comedy" or any movie from the ground up, but it was nice next to the star "rigid too," Gerard Butler, who showed his abilities of comedy during the events and dialogue unexpectedly at all. The Ugly Truth or "bitter truth" are not features of the scenario Almahbk or the many scenes that will affect your memory to remember after discharge from the cinema. But I assure you that you will remember how many smiles of comic situations which will bring Butler "Cynic" Phaigel "serious", and how it became a whole movie like a tutorial for the women how they can get a man dreams, but without the white horse who "knee" or robe knights who "wear ". Where Butler explains Higel all the time how much they care primarily at men all that is "superficial" in women, the literal sense of the word, which means that its primary is always Bmphatn body front and rear more than "nonsense" and "Alai" talk that fills the head-. And the original problem of being not connected, although they are beautiful is waiting for a man dreams that impossible and quality of life already with the ideal of excess imagine it, though it does not imagine an object "Mngerh six slots", for example, it is an ordinary person, but without focusing on the orientation of animal . Funny story actually made the performance of Butler's Comedy frankly surprised me when I became, I'm almost the entire world, remind him of his role in the movie "300" Spartan commander "brutal" in the battlefield, who fought until the last breath in his body. This is not that the value of the role of "womanizer" in the film "cultural" - on the grounds that an educational tutorial for women - it is not difficult for him to perform. The Higel I really can not see it represented a strong performance in form or in any work I've seen it, but I can say that they are applicable to them also say that they "livelihood"! The film is really very nice, the theme of "Bjehp" but cute, and I will tell you that you are in the case of watching this movie and you are a bad mood and I passed the day bad, as happened to me, I guarantee you that the hour and a half will change from "Mowodk" perfectly!
