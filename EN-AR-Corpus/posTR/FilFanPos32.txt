Omar and Salma since the first moment in the film was "Atakteft," for you with the beginning you will feel like you're in half of the film, for example, and not in the first moments, and this method was not, in dramas, which usually make you bored at the beginning and then trying to attract attention after a while, and the Like a lot. With the first moment you will discover that the "lifetime" of the film's hero suffers separation from his beloved "happy" that have left him in search of fame and stardom, and in the first ten minutes and are fast and "boring" you will know the duo's past and the circumstances that kept them apart. What I liked also, footage for each of the "age" and "peaceful" and they were talking to each other through the camera, and of course, "service" capabilities Tamer Hosni Lom√© Izz al-Din in control terms and their faces are completely automatic. For the scenario written by Ahmed Abdel-Fattah has tried to exit ", the artist," Akram Farid with Montier Moataz Writer in the creation of film and realistic as possible the number of minutes allowed, because they certainly they delete a number of scenes have been filmed already, but they succeeded in the end to submit events, convincing most of the time , despite the "bouts" simple can be overlooked. Camera Director of Photography Mohsen Nasr was Mwt Rh in the events, but I did not like most of the scenery of the meeting, television, which was conducted with the "joy" and the director who discovered "Sheriff," When the camera show announcer directs her question to the joy, the other camera is by "g WM "prompt on the face of the guest in a television screen hanging behind the anchor with each question, it may be the reason for that is my feeling that this movement has always been related to the discovery is a scary thing or person" Atznq "difficult or embarrassing question accompanied by special music for" Ta Ta Taaaaa ".. because I do not find what" useful "for use in the meeting. And the representation I would like to begin by star work Tamer Hosni, who appeared much of maturity about the singer rookie who appeared in the film "Love" in 2004, which was referred to Hineha that "in his first performance was automatically acceptable to a large extent, which attend the public to receive the representative of a new singer in the world of cinema, "and certainly different from the performance was" The Lord of the emotional ". Watching drama was impressive and convincing, especially the two scenes with his father that his body Ezzat Abu Ouf, and there is a scene "bar", which appeared at the beginning of the film when he saw the "age" sweetheart "happy" with her new, Tamer did not open his mouth, but the expressions of his face screamed including poetry by the "age", the spectacle of "Omar," which tells the "joy" that he loves to "peaceful". But what surprised me was his appearance in the film as a "comedy", with the submission of comments and attitudes of funny comic most of the events, which I think is making it a competitor of the comedy stars like Mohamed Heneidy and Mohamed Saad, Ahmad Hilmi, Hani Ramzi coming period. We bring Mai Izz Al-Din, which is already smaller than those in the film "Do the" - "The experience of the past years gained in her film and television made her a" Dough soft "can be shaped however you want, but they are of yeast is good and the basis of sound would be any form they appear appropriate and wonderful them. " This is what happened in the role of "peaceful" by Mai where the "mood" is beautiful, and I remember her scene "Mokattam" which we know the reason for the old wound of her fiance by the Representative of Mohammed Suleiman, where the features of her face reflected the pain of this wound brilliantly. Dr. Ezzat Abu Ouf still surprise me carpet e e performance and spontaneity favorite of the "imminent", but Marwa Abdel Monem was the "fruit" lightly blood film and the performance of her simple , Mohammed Suleiman, despite appearing a little but it was the "center", and Rami and a single, although I was expecting he would be "w was" on the screen but that his role as villain was acceptable for him too, and mst in Haridi you wish to see him say the words of the concept, but presented young "Almst and to" friend "Omar" the blood of light. The shock was violent at Mays Hamdan made "happy", when I saw this young woman held a celebrity in its CBM Or in a program of Dr. Hala Sarhan on Rotana, predicted it would be a "genius" in the representation, but their performance of "joy" was empty and frustrating, especially with the presence, together with other representatives who have their roles brilliantly, to feel like he was sad to reflect the representative of the other the role of "joy" to see the facilitator and to "give!" It may be a relationship that this work is representative of actual experiences of the first, but I still hope to see it made a strong performance in the work of another. I would like to pay tribute to the massive propaganda campaign and "early", which provided for the film, I can not find the defect as some have claimed, because in the film industry and especially the American ones begin advertising for the films before the general assessment: 4
