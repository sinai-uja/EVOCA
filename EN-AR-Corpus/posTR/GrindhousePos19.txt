Name of the movie: American Gangster What distinguishes Ridley Scott for the rest of the directors is his insistence on the creation of different worlds in all his cinematic experience, where we lived the era of Roman gladiators and the Crusaders in Jerusalem and space monsters and many other experiments, in the film American Janjster wanted Ridley Scott did not enter the field of new tempted by, the world of gangs and drugs in America, The biggest challenges of the film is its release in 2007, after the masterpiece of action films The Departed winning best picture at the Oscars one year only, the opinion of many that it is not in the interest of Ridley Scott to release his film this year, but we trust when Ridley viewing of the film in Last November, the story of the film adapted from real events, Cite author wonderful Stephen Zielean (owner Alsinaro winner Oscar Schindler's List) through the article have allowed Gazette about Frank Lucas, who attracted his attention as the first leader of the mafia black in America, is exactly how the story begins, he begins to Frank Lewis founded the Mafia has its own family members and friends and trade in drugs imported from Africa illegally and unknown, In this scenario we see a lot of similarities with the great gangster film Godfather where Schahdjaw family happy, including the prevailing, and see the last scene of crime team, which does not have mercy, do not deny that during the movie I remembered seeing a lot of scenes from the Godfather, and why not do it the way out? P is the Godfather and undoubtedly School for Film and Mafia gangs, Next to last of the scenario we see the policeman Roberts, who is going through the problems of divorce and infidelities with professional honesty, what he did to Stephen in the scenario of work well done, we have seen rapid and psychological changes experienced by the action figures and fruit to the events of work, detailed figures detailed accurate and perhaps the first personal I will mention is Frank Lucas, with the variability of social and affection of his family with his brothers and his mother, But what is to come out of his house we see the most dangerous man walking on the land of America, a black man and not Italy, not wear regalia and do not brag to the world, intelligent and knows what he would do in his next move, on the other hand deals with the writer of the social life in that period through personal cop Roberts, who neglected his family is in crisis and difficult divorce, Personal volatile in every scene do not really know whether the Secretary or a traitor, honest in his work and a traitor in his life, indirectly tells us by the police, mostly used the drug in that period to earn a livelihood of subsistence and traded it and passed it, and this was the reason The main drug in the prosperity of those terrifying way in the dark period, And a suspicious manner that indicates that the American soldiers in the Vietnam war were traitors, and were busy drug instead of fighting, and this indictment significant to America and its army but remains instabilmente point of view, Stephen, we turn to Ntqp other strong in the movie, that is representation, Denzel Matt Spetalnick WASHINGTON keen here with ferocity, strong, coherent, intelligent, Frank Lucas-making role for Denzel, no doubt, Of course, this stems not so easily workmanship, Denzil visited the real Frank Lucas, he studied his movements, his character, even save gait horror! Without doubt one of the best roles Denzel Washington, the other hand, see Russell Crowe starring as well, the role of the beautiful of it, and persuasive, but did not reach the degree of dazzling who drew us Denzel, Ruby Dee that the old man, which finally arrived this year for the theater Alkudak all shine on the role of mother Lucas Frank, who was the least I can describe is "fabulous!" Although its role in the film was within ten minutes, but undoubtedly the best 10 minutes in the film, characterized the film as well in several areas, including fashion, music, artwork purely added for this action drama to complement and make it a film close to the integration and one of the best movies year at all.
