5 - Movie Name: The Hole Rating: 6.5/10 The story revolves around a girl Liz fines that one school youth that are current, but the boy does not attach little interest. With the passage of events, find themselves trapped with the girl and 2 other young boys in place of closed forest. What would happen then?!! I think the film is classified as one of the more movies psychological conflict and not as a movie from horror movies, but the beginning might suggest otherwise. Movie distinct in terms of psychological portray the conflict in the aspects of the girl and Liz try to connect to the viewer as either recessive very insane or just a girl again. Film production line was possible to be much better and was able to add a screenwriter, especially the events of the strongest in the end.
