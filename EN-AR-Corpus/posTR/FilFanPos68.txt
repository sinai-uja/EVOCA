Abu Ali is clear Tot R. Belal Fadl Film Composer cinema bakacad Maninat those that depend on the duck's People's capable of doing what no Istt pw public to achieve in reality and that the form of Adel Imam and Nour El-Sherif models of choice, even if it ducks for a thief must be Taatat P is better for him Pft Dysarthria, but financial circumstances forced him to steal, but preferred the previous two tests with Kareem Abdul-Aziz in the "thieves in the KGB Tu" and "Al-Basha pupil," that the best experiences of critical and mass compared Pflmih "Warez Sea" and "Aunt France" which Nala, Noor Aziz, seen from criticism At degenerated due to The language of dialogue as they have not made a huge hit, and we find it avoids in his film, Abu Ali and thus preferred to have reached what he wants in the third line and Ath about this film. In spite of the multiplicity of experiences of Karim Abdel-Aziz, but we find it lacks a permanent renewal is one of the best youth of his generation but does not provide what develops talent actor and prove its efficacy through the roles of vehicles with different dimensions of the role of the last, and only just re-roles, taking advantage of love of the public to him and his desire to see This pattern of characters. And on the other side, is the Mona Zaki has benefited from the film, having provided a new identity outside the scope of the girl kind good that came out of her cloak also successfully in my aunt France despite everything, they are in this film infected with tension, fear and distrust as they Mlfozp from her mother also did not help you find the desired who was loving it, had succeeded in weaving features intelligently. Also, Discover Khaled El Sawy himself again in the role of "happy Iraqi" very influential in the course of events, which is one of the biggest roles of his former space after Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was probably the reason for staying away from the cinema long after failing commercially. The Ahmed Galal film's director, Vengda may develop a combination accustomed to ensure the success of the film include "something in everything," without attention to the contents of good going on around him the film, even win his bet on any of those things to attract the public towards the box office, which Manjeh it already, but also did not provide what deserves to be mentioned on the contrary, scattered, often in public. While he was the best in the film music Amr Ismail wonderful and the mouthpiece of the dramatic scene within the context of the film, although you insert between the fast during the scenes of Action and smooth to fit the glow of love between the hero and sometimes sad to correspond with the disease younger brother of the hero, but she did not dispersion of the public as do the film, which seemed like a cocktail of human feelings. Interest in the young child, "Joseph," the brother of the hero to collect the paper from the apple, thinking that he will pull it aspires to win it, one of the best of what had been provided during the movie as a good indication of what is reached in the case in our society from the control culture competitions minds. Odd and even Almthirelldhishp that many of those who saw the film "talked about the reason for the absence of Hassan Hosni Will become the artist Hassan Hosni is a salt that must be placed on the eating public to digest?!" Is not it important that the role of the artist and not be "separated" for him this role? On a final note it must not occur it is very simple, but reflect the extent of non-interest movie makers by the end For the Tartars were writing the name Kareem Abdul-Aziz "Ali," although it "good" or even "Abu Ali"!
