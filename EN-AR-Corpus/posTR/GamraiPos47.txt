 47 - Movie Name: The Damned United Rating: 7.5/10 in an hour and a half indulge in the seventies of the last century in England, To live with Brian more epochs splendid and other, more misery, living environment and Hamas Premier League at the time, mole and bad, an atmosphere of fans and media and the players, despite the short film, and the passage of time with incredible speed, you feel as if you lived a unique experience, Personally, I consider that this is the best film about football, and rather wonderful film about the sport in general, Simply because he was mixing sports and drama together, Voatttna attractive and exciting mix, which created the film director and photographer and staff representative, because you feel like you are watching a documentary, for a spherical historical periods. We all know that cinema Oboukst against football in her films, I think about it, always after watching any work around that, but Tom Hooper, who won yesterday's Academy Award for Best Director, he found us a solution to the crisis, say that the film did not focus on football only , but beautiful in it that dealt with pride, Alcdja, ambition, success, failure, friendship and love in the part of football. At all stages of the film has not been much focus on the games, in most of the time we see either dialogues between Bryan and his colleague, Peter, or between him and the club manager or players or talk family, administrative, and beautifully was to focus on the features of each character, the actors were given every what they have and make one live with them because they are embodied events events are impressive. As I mentioned the film addresses several issues the most important of blind ambition and Alcdja, and arrogance as well as Brian Clough, although goodness of the Interior, also criticized the film some things such as habits of football players at that time and roughness as well as fraud and disregard for the rulers. The film speaks more precisely about 44 days he spent Brian as head coach of Leeds United, before being expelled, the events are based on the novel by "David Pace," the same name, where he wrote about things from the point of view, but remains the key events are the same only difference is in the details and formalities. Way of passing events of the film impressive scenes occur in a matter of time duration of 6 years and exactly what between 1968 and 1974, so it may a bit puzzled at first, because things may get lost and mixes between times, but depth will be clear after things better. Movie dialogues are all beautiful and explicit, and make you are interested in each orbiter and what is being said and being, as the most liked in the film is that British English accent and high representatives, enjoyed ears. He added that Michael Sheen has the best roles of his career Kprayn Clough, he is the genius of the body of stubbornness, intelligence, Subtle, ironic, disadvantages of the great Brian Clough, who despite characterized, but it remains a genius training in the history of English clubs, because he was never one of several that went up with two teams from second division and won them many titles, back to Michael has excelled in the film , this drama shows how his talent, In many of the shots are close-ups of his face feel that men suffer internally and feel that he is suffering from war difficult in itself between envy and ambition blind, which almost makes him lose everything from his family and his job and his close friend, Michael's body man a dreamer, a complex personal , good-hearted, many of ridicule and criticism, arrogant, is a wonderful and unique, so much so that you feel that it's too much, The way to speak and walk and smile make him a genuine copy of Brian, and even that the body of a particular charisma of Brian, do not feel the difference between them. Short film feel that some thing, because things go quickly and the large number of events to force time to pass quickly, though the story is beautifully woven and comedy with some drama of humanity, Photography was wonderful and you really feel nature in the seventies colors and great houses and clothes and avatars that period are wonderful, the atmosphere of the other stadiums are enthusiastic and exciting and you feel you see the real game, although it is not to focus on this aspect so much. It addresses the important things the most important ambition and success and the right way for the achievements, So a person that has become arrogant and stubborn and led by envy or hatred of his eyes become wide open to reality, which affects his life, and that the value of friendship important and significant in life and one has always to be conscious of what to say and what to do about his friends, because at the time of distress did not others find anyone to help you, Ambition is a double edged sword Mmetza in order to attain success and may be a cause of the loss if it is based on things trivial or unrealistic, or even the wishes of the poor. As I said earlier, not all events are real but the movie remains of the finest sports Mhahdhati work is exciting and fun and makes you aware a lot of things in the framework of sports satire, and do not forget that the heart of the matter in the film is the value of friendship and how important in life.
