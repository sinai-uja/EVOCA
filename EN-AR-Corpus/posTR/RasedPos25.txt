Movie Name: Waltz with Bashir - 2008 film tells the real drawing, "Wallis with Bashir" realistic details and to discuss a former Israeli soldiers for the lost memories of the 1982 Lebanon War in which he participated in the Israeli forces. Begins with the soldier, which is the same film's director, who tells the story of the real, this Altenbic in memory of the past after that surprised he does not mention any of them, and after that tells him one of his friends, his former colleagues in the army, for the nightmare he sees every night, because of what he faced during the Lebanese civil war. The escalation of the events of the film and watch the war terrible, remains a soldier - the director - Ari Folman Ari Folman looking for a missing link in his memory until it finds the last of his former colleagues in the army, which Mahzrp Sabra and Shatila massacres committed by the Christian Phalange forces of Lebanon against the Palestinian civilian refugees in Lebanon, tell of been documented through, moment by moment. Notes reviews Enjoyed this film with interest an awful lot of observers, critics, and politicians, has been nominated and won numerous international awards, partly because it did not Israeli tells the details of one of the worst massacres in modern history, the massacre of Sabra and Shatila, which bore the Israel itself part of the responsibility. The title of the film "Wallace with Bashir," is taken from a viewer of the film, which appears when an Israeli soldier carrying a machine gun (MAG), a light fire of machine gun toward the insurgents hiding in buildings in the Hamra Street in Beirut, has been shooting and dancing dance Adjustable Roller Mill Waltz And was succeeded by a large wall which shows the Christian Phalange Party leader Bashir Gemayel, who was also president of Lebanon, and the militants who was assassinated by a Syrian National Socialist Party in Lebanon. After the assassination of Gemayel, members of the Phalange militia entered the camps of Sabra and Shatila armed with knives and axes s arms and muffled sound, and slaughtered thousands of civilians Filst Inyin who were there, have secured the Israeli tanks enter these militants and a link to T at the entrances of the camps, and hit in arms bakacad varicocele Vashp area in front of gunmen battalions of entry and the realization of their knives in the falafel pw Ot Ruff Filst Inyin and draw a cross on their chests with knives. The more you can also reading another post written on the subject here. Arab Monetary face of the film is essentially a Christian Lebanese, so that the film - according to those views - clears from the blood of Jews slaughtered in the massacre, and cast all the blame on the Christian Phalange. But this is not true, it is watching the film with his head not only with his own ears , Will be noted that the narrators of the film (they are real people who, in turn, are themselves as in reality) explain indirectly that Israeli forces shelled the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatila before entering the Phalange militia to prepare for its entry, and one of the soldiers say clearly that they Kano are throwing flares the skies above the camp to light the civilian targets of the militia in connexion with the Almtoglp Night. This instead of scenes more likely showing the Israeli soldiers who are committing acts of murder of civilians in cold blood, like the scene at the beginning of the film in which they appear Mercedes is rainfall with a barrage of Israeli bullets and kills all of the civilians from one family, we do not know the story of this Mercedes only in end of the movie .... However, we can not deny that in general the film highlights the Israeli soldiers as victims, not aggressors, and this is what I tried to convince me by my wife, which highlights the many scenes showing the soldier's main role is not lost if he knows what he is doing (which I'm 19 Years), but is not carried out orders to "shoot everywhere," as he says, as if the soldier is not responsible perpetrator, but the battalion commander who was sitting in a villa occupied Lebanese and watch sex films. In all cases, it is not really great, but for some of the scenes that carry a sexual nature, which did not imagine that she was present in the film, and I was surprised to have emerged, which - despite being graphical is real - ruined a great opportunity to view the movie on the younger generation to know the truth of the massacre, it was director can do without them. What hurt is for the Israeli Jew is the same as he was a soldier of the Israelis who took part in this war and now opposing the war and exposing Zionist crimes and the party Falangist Christian, while the investment wealth of the Arab countries in the payment of billions of football clubs and construction of skyscrapers and fleets of luxury cars.
