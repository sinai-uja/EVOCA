I'm not one of them said was "I'm not one of them" the way he wants Ahmed Gala to give him his art, I encourage him to move it, but with the development of something important in mind, that his film but grossed an encouraging so far, but it is a simple step, he viewed with a critical eye, assess the factors of success, and defines what it is surpassed in the coming films. Film dealt with a simple to several thorny issues in a way that comic was chosen luck to reach young people rejecting the movies tragedies and speeches direct, and was simplified exaggerated made me feel like watching a movie comic, and may be a catalyst for this feeling is anger at the way that underestimated the al-Badri my mind as a viewer in many details. Author and director chose - I do not know why - a duck for their film and his colleagues in the Faculty of T b, then it is supposed to watching them in the Faculty of T b in the pattern Ge Kasr and remote from the campus of the University of Cairo, and Faculty of Agriculture, scenes where most of the outdoor scenes, The front-Badri faq t option to get out of this impasse and then to insert a duck Him another school, or at least make it i Huelva colleges of T b, but does not make me watch a demonstration outside the main gate of the university, w m It me to believe the core of the details taken into account. Another detail that made me laugh in a scene from my breath which is supposed confinement of hyper Kristof line and dysarthria, and I see him embrace the ducks on the verge of a bomb blast in the heart of the focus of e never Vehicles Cairo, Security forces, which then Her Qadeer Ahmed's salary did not stop the good news is in the i Rigaha from the airport and even the focus of e Egypt to take the bomb, in spite of knowing all the moves and told of the rejoicing of the phone, as if waiting for the last minute to intervene, and what to accuse what intervened. Scene was as follows .. Security officers running towards Bushra, along with Gala, led by a man full of civilian clothes, we discover suddenly that the officer explosives, which takes the suitcase bomb in his hand bare, and put it on the ground in the heart of the station, and without wear no helmets or shields or use of any sensitive electronic devices to find out what kind of bomb, open bag in his hand, and dismantled the bomb using a "pincer" .. "There is no magic or juggling." But the details of why I was able rejoicing and glad tidings of Chksyatema to ignore, Fied become proficient in the portrayal of the young man lost after the "movie w Agafi" and "The Night Baghdad Fell," and helped him in his new film, Drawing-Badri of the features of his character accurately, from the lack of relationship between him and his parents , through the provision of factors of corruption from upscale funds without the expense and luxury cars, the end of friends Of the same vein. But taking into account the gala of the nature of his personality Almzbzp was more successful, with the emergence of permanent and reactions shows that the accident is the reason for changing the status of corruption and loss to prayer, study, and the launch of the chin in an attempt to join religious groups, which us believe the movie that good news from them, and all this after the accident, Holiday meets a young man who made the detainee, in his own house meets girl of his dreams by his jealousy. Bushra itself, and that were not the same volatility Holiday but it was full of the same confusion in decision-making or at least the expression of the life of religiosity chosen away from the cup of wine in one hand and her father, as her grandmother suddenly on the necks of her colleagues in a demonstration, holding the microphone, although Kitt Lira hear the words "woman's voice is rougher," who start i saliva militancy, and I still remember the demonstrations i Huelva Muslim Brotherhood in the university and the T Baht walk behind T Huelva silent, hold up the book of God. The relationship between the glad tidings and rejoicing was delicious, a simple H, Ott and Rha drama was largely successful, and provided good news following represent the strongest performance in the film in the period, which began the suspect in fact condemns the line Ebha, especially the scene Mkashiftha his Bhakiqth, but the change that took place for good news after discovering and falling into the trap of deception terrorist network, was unfortunate at all, film is not clear whether this girl pattern narcotic long ago condemned and commitment, or whether they decided to go in i Team openness is limited only to experience the opposite. Badri was successful in most of the focus of S film, and use tools appropriate for the film is light comedy in which stems from the situation, but my advice to the real send to the gala, which like i Rivth to make his films, you have to choose new patterns of characters, and do not make the title of ducks for the sole tempted to give up Give constructive more space for the characters in your film bakacad nuclei, especially if it was offered for the names and then for i In Bibb and Ahmad Ratib and please Jeddawi.
