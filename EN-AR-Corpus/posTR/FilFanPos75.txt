Dreams real I always find a barrier between any movie they mean by the director as a "horrible and Almt seen and mysterious", Vokt t what I'm looking for in the film is human, and few movies Archaeological ball which made me feel figures the film and her feelings and make me or take the P with it and put myself in their place, and the movie " dreams real, "one of those few films, which enables the director Mohamed Gomaa of the dye film Duck Aba human depth strongly selected to the armpit. Let us read the film of the four sides, which filled propaganda poster, which made three of them the credentials of many make you locked in the experience of watching film to raise Egypt sincere is the first experiment, the director and you are assured that you at least you will see the representative of sublime, and the match in performance between Khaled Saleh, Hanan Turk, Fathi Abdul Wahab. And valid in this role was of the utmost serenity and calm, gave us the role of the husband loving his wife love ten, after the traditional marriage ends up alienated or his daughter from him, in spite of desperate attempts to be submitted by the favor to regain her love, and calm, which was started by the favor of the film and the rhythm of speech and features his personality was the occasion of the events and the rhythm of the film well. As you said, but Ddha know things, the quiet husband and cohesion explained the tension that coexistence of the wife, and his love for his daughter and his house, said dimension is the justification for his wife, and the center has not made us for that, falling short in his wife's right, even as he discovers she is living better away from his friends and e, even as he urges them not to be the guest of honor in her life, but best of all the T Leaflet, which deal with his wife suspected of being lethal or at least capable of exposing him and his daughter to the line t, to fall in a dilemma between her and the fulfillment of his and his fear of the unknown. The Story Hanan Turk is different, it has adopted Astt carpet e expression for the unit locked herself in, pulled the scenes, quietly engagement with it after P Ath Art discontent e Bt Leaflet, which treated her daughter and her husband, though Bt sell the scenes that followed the start of doubts in itself is Alokt R. difficulty in personal, but Hanan excelled in those scenes more, and even when the camera captures the face of tenderness in the scenes is scary after half bakacad I of the film was faq R. Hanan focused and personal expression. Perhaps a meeting with the officer Former lover in her house and her husband in front of one of those scenes, as well as scenes of Search Behold, for the same prayer and return to her daughter and her family, as well as enable the tenderness and sense of deep personality, but the makeup of personal was a contributing factor strongly to show the suffering faced by, besides shivering and emaciated, who demonstrated by Hanan, had a pallor of her face and wrapped in black around her eyes Ath Ra in acceptable proof ball P greater engagement with personal and credible. As Fathi Abdel Wahab, although there did not give a large area to follow up the details of his life, but that did managed to summarize the history of personal in how to deal with his ex-girlfriend and married now and place of the indictment, as well as to clarify the extent of his relationship with his with that we did not see it with his family at all, the picture is set on his desk for him and his wife host the two smaller size for i Fillet, Fri carefully put one picture on the face of the mother, and i did not show and the film only through telephone calls to her husband, who was angry whenever v occurs. Abdel-Wahab brilliantly on the ruthless nature of man investigations, showed Fri through his dealings with the informant in these rounds of questioning, even in his dealings with his colleagues, however, all that stands in front of a scene discovered that his sweetheart is still wearing a chain of small gold, lense everything, and even bring down the accounts of the defendant looking for any other committees last. The Dalia Buhairi, which though still far from Altt She considered the dramatic, it does what it Bkiva e in clamping s that have appeared, and expressed i sell diseased mental brilliantly, you may be Ath I said her experience growing in this type of characters, especially with the duck and Tha of the series of "cry Ont Z", but I think - not acceptable proof of each conjecture PM - that the character was unbearable more space, and if you ask for an excuse to gather it in intensify In the personal history and background in the end to retain the same element of mystery and suspense until the last minute. To go out all the main characters of the film so clearly means standing director and unconscious behind the camera, enabling the use of management tools and expertise represented that it provides LES with his first work, however, did not stop at Fri existing human potential he has, but rather he provided performance Impressive in the use of imaging tools of lighting e cadres and camera movement smooth and wonderful, and that the choice of filters was adding to the image and work great. And these things added to non-free stretch film from some who stole the director and writer in their quest to reach the ball ambiguity wath faq T attractive, and added a question about the bruises that were in the face of Fathi Abdel Wahab, when a scene end though we did not see it has been subjected to any altercation of some kind, and ask for the hospital, Helwan and psychological, which was a dilapidated building while the files inside as they are, and even some modern. Vmonteg though a major pillars of the film, especially in weaving nightmares that inspire the ducks Him with the fact, but I felt the faq t than once that there is something incorrect, Fmchd burning the house followed by the seating of the four mother, father and daughter and friend at a rest home and everything in its place, the font may be a of at the film-makers inadvertently, may be in my mind alone, despite the involvement of others to the same questions, then I will answer this puzzling as collecting perhaps explains.
