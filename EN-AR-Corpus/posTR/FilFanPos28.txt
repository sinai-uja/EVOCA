Astgmaip The name "Astgmaip" including raised us from the memories of boyhood for the game favorite disappearing and appearing might suggest to us that we are on a date with the film with the rhythm of the breathless, to dissipate our thinking with the first quarter of the film Emad Albhatt, which employed all his energies to focus on personalities, and diving in their hearts and giving them the right to speak freely, and a long time for themselves, like placing them under the electron microscope. Film-type narrative going on in one place, here is a must to dive into the details and dimensions for Fair Ge compare the types of other film and then for movies Archaeological ball or movies that rely on the event in the escalation of the drama, to begin the follow-up film from the angle narrow given to us by Albhatt , with a willingness to dive in the depths of his characters, which Siwt t the past faq t of Tot See the present. Perhaps Albhatt did not choose the easy way to present his first film, as the consequences of the many he had to think about when listing the events of the film, such as fatigue, which may be up to the viewer, sentences of dialogue, linking the film to the past through flashback, and diversification in dealing with the same actor and place through lens of the camera Kamal Abdul Aziz. Let's start with the latter, which was more elements of the film conciliation, the beginning of moves the chain, through Bidhaeth natural especially with the light of early morning, the end of a scene filmed for the generator I'm forcer and the singing of vocalist famous Yassin Altohamme, The advent of the center of this crowd is extremely difficult, and that the working group was governed by the appropriate time. However, the camera Abdul Aziz to deal with the formations, the vehicle for people high professionalism, they are not successful somewhat in its dealings in the long shots with the faces of the representatives, as the focus was on the actor, speaking of the periods may be brought up on the minute may enter the viewer in the case of boredom, especially in the film taking place mostly in a villa among the seven. Champions of the seven they had the burden is not easy, as they move between present and past, between representation in the tradition of each other or talk to them about themselves honestly, and if they decided to suddenly out of the hide and seek and delivery to disclose what they are secret remained Darunha from each other for years. Sharif was more characters confused, but it was the most stand-off to make us sympathize with him, and we feel lake, and because the representative Ahmed Yahya was always the wolf, and the expressions of one, you may accept this point out that the personal standing confused and thinking about the problem, but we Snanar a bit and we see scenes flashback of the character the same straying. Perhaps the trick flashback and carried out by Albhatt professionalism, was assisted in editing, enabled him to mix the film smoothly, although the use of slightly larger will add to the film, it would have been a camel individual in the dialogue, especially when we hear the character tells the position of the second party in the old position, without us back to the position to become alive for us and we feel rather than hear Mgia. However, the narrative Albhatt dialogues personalities, and Tracs smooth finish them, we have made already in the game Astgmaip, and make the focus of the viewer chasing each character a little, we feel the tragedy of Sheriff dispersed between past the governor and his sweetheart liberal, to find ourselves listening to the captain Tarek Tlemceni he talks about his beloved and only after him . Tlemceni added Kitt Lira appearance, even though he is not a lot of experience in the world of Altmt Yale, but it Alokt t experience among the younger people, and I liked very i leaflet definition Albhatt us the beginning of the relationship Tlemceni or Alhaji Yahya group of youth, because it was the answer to the question had in mind, Noor Aziz perceive ago beginning of the film, and when you provide the answer did not come duck leaflet directly in response to the question: "what way I knew Joseph," but came T. answer after the biggest problem for Yahya himself, we find ourselves in our gut we say "Oh, so you know some." Joseph was far from being a quiet character, contrary to what may appear from the rhythm of his speech, because its various resolutions up to speed to frivolity, here are clear literal Albhatt in our definition of all these decisions while maintaining a calm Yusuf, especially when he takes his decision to return to love Salma. Personal Salma personal vehicle is very, formulated through the script was deep, and we got on her life and the way in making their decisions without live with every detail passed by, but Heidi Karam you can not often connect the suffering of this character as fully to us, despite what appears in this The young actress of promising possibilities. However, Heidi, which could overtake the absolute level of representation on the new face of the representative of the Algerian Sarah Bassam, not aids her to excel on the character of recent Fassarp excelled in the provision of character, the thing on it, <User Rating: 3
