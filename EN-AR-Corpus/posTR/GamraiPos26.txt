26 - Movie Name: The African Queen  Rating: 9 / 10 third cooperation of John Houston and Humphrey Bogart, which I saw, and I considered the best, given the nature of the story that made the film, and because of the high performance by the hero the film "Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn," and who Haza which Aoskara each,, I,, Man working on a vessel, cheap, and the second woman arose within the confines of a religion and a religious school, they met after the attack the German forces on the village of African relationship that grew between them, as persons of different character, habits, was the best in the film, from the fluctuation in giving me this relationship, which has become an integrative and participatory process, in order to desire to live, And willingness to cooperate to achieve one goal, and that seemed impossible, the bombing of a German ship giant lowest possibilities available after cutting one of the toughest roads river fraught with various kinds of risks, in the same year, the automatic Kazan his film the famous Streetcar Named Desire, which resulted from Marlin Brando in which one of the most important performances of the decade, but Oscar did not Incefh, Went to the statue to the African Queen, which provided performers are quite impressive, he reminded me of Braiap John Houston shared a "treasure walk Madri", the best Bogart reincarnation dress navigator Drudge as Miner miserable in the past, and it seems that these roles are more than what it deserves , was also marked by John Houston hire him where, Even though they are in my opinion, a failure failure in Vlmanma classic Key Largo who his feet together before this movie years, the film, which is the field of choice for both, Movies, Nawar classic, I think that the features of Bogart cruel and nature of the physical fits the roles of such a "treasure walk Madri - African Queen ", but nevertheless, I find that Brando in the same year was more deserving of the award, And by a comfortable margin, but as usual, the prize may not do justice always the most deserving, and it seems to me that Bogart as one of the biggest stars in their forties, was awarded the prize this in front of a boy again, Last Chance in the film Kazan the other, and history equitable deserves the,, and the prize characterized by the most famous at that time, despite the excellent performance of their receivers.
