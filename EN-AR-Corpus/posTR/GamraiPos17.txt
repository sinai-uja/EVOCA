17 - Movie Name: Waltz with Bashir Rating: 9 / 10 Sabra and Shatila camps, villages, went over to the two wounds in the fabric of history, his film, was not material film, as far as it is historical material, and documentary, directed by film Holocaust in a way, talking about the massacres in the history of the Arabs, is sufficient alone, to find out the depth of this wound, and how the impact, not only in the history of the silent, but also in human memory, Whatever the position was filmed and directed the film in a way Alaenemishn, in my opinion for specific reasons, first to consider what forms the film, historical material archived, secondly to control the exact features and expressions of his characters, the way in which the film's and the way they dealt with his idea of requiring the performance of a particular kind ,, I find it very difficult to make the performance of the film describes the state of humanity and the impact it has had, Third is the ability of this style of directing the dissemination of ideas in everything, colors in particular, to reflect on the state of unconscious is, not very influential, he was able to send their ideas in the simplest way, and that what is missing in Arab cinema, which was supposed to be proactive to provide glimpses of the dark history of the Arabs, And seriousness in dealing with these profiles, transparency, missing completely, leading what I saw in the film is a way to address the idea and the way he posed, and the method is bold in his presentation, the beginning of the film explains itself, made when he is like Bnstaloggio to a group of Israeli soldiers in southern Lebanon, the invasion Israeli Beirut following the assassination of Bashir Gemayel, former President of the Phalange Party, And refuted the complicity that witnessed this period between the militias of the Phalange Party and the coverage of the military for Israeli troops to kill hundreds of residents of Palestinian refugee camps in Beirut, may seem the idea of coverage of the military for the massacre, in itself a crime as portrayed by the film, but I see that in a lot of evasion of the truth, and history, And the support of Israeli troops into side tanks armored witness the events of the massacre, the kind of twisting and turning, I remember well, the lawsuit filed by one of the survivors of the massacres of Sabra and Shatila massacres against Ariel Sharon in international courts for years and specifically in the period preceding its slumber and death ,, after his involvement not only in coverage, but in the massacres, the Phalange Party, There is no doubt that a black mark, in the history of the Arab people not to book the date yet, but received the penalty a lot of the leaders of Israel, headed by Ariel Sharon, who was not satisfied just to see Amin Jameel, President of the Phalange Party currently topping the platform the presidency of Lebanon in the period from periods of civil war only, but blurted gift worthy of all he has done and his party, Ozzy new gun, draw a friendship.
