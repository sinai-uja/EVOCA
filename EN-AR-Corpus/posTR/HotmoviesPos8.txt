Julie and Julia wrote: Ahmad Abou El Fadl Rating: 3,5 of 5 Starring: Meryl Streep, Amy Adams Directed by: Nora Efron entire movie lies with the three women, I do not think that the film was possible to have fun without any one of them, Meryl Streep The first is the interface of the film, Meryl play a real character, take on personal well-mastered the accent, filled with details of performance, But all these things perfectly for the performance of a real person is no longer enough to applaud Merrill, perhaps because we are accustomed from Merrill that would be excellent. The other side of the film comes from the spirit of the writer and director of the film, Efron Nora, Nora know a lot about people and about relationships, and no doubt they know much about industry also make a film enjoyable, The film tells the success stories of two women from two times different they have shared interest in the food, eating and cooking and to write about and share with others a passion for preparing and eat a alike, do not meet the two stories in the film and moving each of them separately in parallel, yes there is good reason to cut the story this way, Vjuli (Amy Dams), which embodies the personal contemporary of them is the legend of Kitchen American Julia (Meryl Streep) of a book last for cooking French all the details of her life and its sense of humor and always upbeat, which enabled it to overcome the difficulties encountered during the preparation for her book, and separates the two stories more than forty years, there is no high drama in the film, The problem is too small to bear the weight of interestingness, and the conflict develops traditional, but the real interestingness in the film comes from two sources: first, policy Nora Efron visual always interesting, places, food, personalities, everything in the film is a comfortable and cumbersome, the details of food and cooking appetite is already open, and the use of light for the length of the movie music almost make view it "easy", Not the music kind of obvious, but it's always appropriate to the environments of the scene and assist in preparing the atmosphere of the next scene, and although the film moves, alternating between the stories but I did not feel I was watching two films, is one movie is going on in two places and two times, I do not think that this thing easy, particularly as the rhythm flows quite easily. Finally comes the biggest source of interestingness in the film for me, Amy Adams, Amy Adams appears on the screen is sufficient to make me care about and interact and I smile, I remembered that during its seen in the movies Enchanted and Doubt, and how much was innocent in the roles, and was also here, with lots of spontaneity, Yes, they were good personality and performance and Excellent appearance from Amy Adams, but I think that a movie or two films coming to Amy play them the same personal kind of innocent and not in its interest fully, Yes Amy Adams needs to diversify aggressively trying to run out quickly, and Hollywood is able to do so.
