Girls Downtown if booked scene beginning and the end of the movie you will find a good movie with a story consistent all friends of the middle class poor, one slit prefer movement "him" and other "Indian" dream wedding night and Itarafan two young men, "Khalid" and "I survived" and impersonate each character other and identify the Habibhma expected, but all that changed later. And tried to avert from watching the beginning and the end for several reasons Fmchd first it was strange because the back of main characters the film Iarafana Bchksithma which is possible but it is necessary we will know every detail of the events and the scene finally saw the speed of a stranger in terminated after many problems and without any Mspqat League Menna Khaled married ! Then he wanted a summit in maturity and performance of the personality of mites Man completely different than previously submitted, may be this movie Int to courteous of new to him after the movie "The Storm" by Khaled Youssef, who appeared through Hani Salama Kpt's outside the guise of e Youssef Chahine, and in return It bit Khaled Abul-Naga always maintained that he does not have any contract to include eye in dealing with the scenario and accept the role of "Samir", which if measured "Palmazhurp" we find he was young, did not impose the same Kpt For despite his roles cinematic consecutive successful, but I also find that Khalid is not Igermn roles is always a man slave who is to fall in love with any Ont Z until it becomes enslaved to her as it was in the "sleepless nights" of Hani Khalifa and "Arabian nationals n, a laboratory and a Thief" to Daoud Abdel-Sayyed. As i have of it was great as usual for the preventive and the crossing is very comfortable in front of the camera, and the role of Jasmine faq R. roles of central and the rise and fall and scenes Mwt Rh, including Mchdha with the younger brother who is trying to impose an intermediate dysarthria them to change their behavior, which paid to cut her hair Ltt bit to have a lot of things, as well as the position of the slaughter of the goose, "I love you" associated T by Kitt Lira and grown their hands before they see in front of grilled at the table! , One of the most influential was the scene of the viewer and standing behind the singer Rico to convince Samir as a singer in the choir many teams, but I survived discover what engineered with her friend to be closed in front of the microphone, all pivotal scenes in the film. Imaging was good, especially the cameraman Kamal Abdel Aziz managed this huge number of outdoor scenes, both In the street or subway, and note only that is the emergence of the metro in the film faq t from armpit God, and in spite of not feeling Bamoosaqp soundtrack for the film, which is not a bad thing, it is not stretch Loeb to attract of music the attention of the viewer faq t of the events of the film, but that film song "Daughters of the center of the country" Rico was good, although it is the same i Rivth Standing to sing Fair children of Ge and the development of certain words in a similar holy. The most important thing in the film as a continuation of cinema system the correct and there is more than a good personal and pivotal in the film and not to rely on one star, as he continued to film the few interested in the topics of social, which feels that the heroes of this film are the problems of society, such as what happened with the film "Sahar Nights "of Hani Khalifa and" Best of Times "by Hala Khalil and" Inta Omri "Khaled Youssef. The rest of the representatives of the film I felt that all the guests of honor Mqahmin roles or not received attention in the scenario, except the role of Magda El-Khatib, who was his importance in the events in contrast to regular salary Ahmed and Ahmed Bedier, which seemed to increase the breakdown of floor area for homosexuals big. I think that the problem of the film was that it focused on what can not pay attention to and passed unnoticed on the unforgivable to focus on it, as happened in a scene hair cut from him and the slaughter of the goose.
