Capote wrote: Slumdog Rating: 5 out of 5 Starring: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener Director: Bennett Miller (Bring Khalata, put it (a dead man walking) and (adaptation) and (Shakespeare loved) and Ikhvgaha well .. you'll get ( Capote)) .. To bring me back to Capote - and there is great difference between the two versions - I had a trip contemplative in creative looking for real work comes from the heart, is sincere in his soul, a real experience, it finds in the massacre carried out by two men in four people from one family, because he believed that any true story can be converted to excellent literary work, if they found the correct way ..
