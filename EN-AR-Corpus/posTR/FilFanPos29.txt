Omar and Salma toughest challenge may be chosen by the Egyptian director of the new century is to try to add the symbols of romance, placing them next to the names "Abraham, a unique" movie studio "Habibi always" and "Mona Ahmed" movie studio "more precious than my life," and "Salah and Samiha" in " Pad-free ".. The list, which wanted the director Akram Farid Ashekaya extended to include the new "Omar and Salma". The problem is that most love stories, which booked a place for itself in the memory of cinema and the public was based on romance, and the accompanying emotion, grief and pain of the lovers, which he sought a unique aside in his new film, because he knows that the era in which we live is not a substitute lover it under the balcony of his sweetheart, It is not the era in which the public easily accepts the film does not raise Dgath from time to time. With the idea the previous film is, since the star is so young fiddler, who lives the life of luxury thanks to the funds of his father, and he does what he wants followed by the father "Filati", and women in his life two models, one left for fame and rapid success, and the second girl working and studying at the same time to provide life for herself away from her parents. This method is realistic formulated by a unique author and hero of the movie Tamer Hosni life heroes were capable of providing modern model of the love stories, but Fred could not salvation completely from the traditional form, which explained the beginning of his film, since the star was crying his sweetheart, "joy" in the Holiday love, and trying to get back to her, sobbing out, and suddenly appears the other side of Omar, the fiddler and comedian. However, differences start from the atmosphere of the comedy in most regions does not deny the excellence severe, Fred managed to imprisonment breath viewers love story finished summed up in the scenes of many successive, in the background was the song "Your Voice" expressive, and the performance of the representatives were good, especially Mays Hamdan done good in mime most of the scenes that represent the long-right. After this strong start to come some "filler" which is repeated throughout the film, and then taken by the girl's age to bed without knowing her name, and begin to link "clowning," he describes himself as a duck and then for the "circus balloon," or then For the scene that shows where Omar and his friend and twitching around them because of domestic wine in khaki clothes, which strongly Odgni personally, but he pushed me to the question, why are you unique? Yes to what is unique and wasted his time in the comic scenes inserted in the film intrusive, do not add something of the character, and the evolution of the film, especially since the film's characters were fun enough, especially ducks For Omar, who made comedy spontaneously, as well as a personal close friend, Princess, and the relationship between father and son, all these characters and attitudes represented by the color of the public were able to make people laugh and automatic selling ducks. Fattamr transfer performance greatly from his recent "Lord of the emotional" to the reassuring, suggesting that this young man represents the severity of the good, and succeed when it becomes in the hands of director versed, especially with the addition of acceptance enjoyed by on the screen, and grass-roots Tamer vocalist successful, represent a guarantee any product to the feet of the tournament award for his audience Tamer, who will come at least to view it represents. If we bear in mind i sell personal life we will know how big the Tamer with this film, Omar person's Playboy features a lightly the blood, which will make the public accept it, along with his heart, Elixir, which is trying to heal mobility among girls, which will gain him entanglement P public, through the contrast in reactions and then For trying to help his ex-girlfriend and forget about the joy of his appointment with his sweetheart of the current peaceful. Selma and the story again, Fred gave us a girl far from fun and openness experienced by age, trying to hide the old wound, and looking for work to help her to Mtt is life, and refuses to love and the link Suddenly, after falls in love with Omar see other personal, different in dress and speech and even principles, that have refused to i leaflet age in the fondling of a girl going through at the university, then became a link were to accept quietly and laughing, flirting her boyfriend by hand to the girls in the street! Differences that emerged by the character Selma before and after her love for a lifetime, featured significantly in their differences with him, is that rejected her boyfriend's former he hit her once, accepted the blow strong from her lover the current and forgave him on the spot, and even when they complained in his betrayal, reaction was different from what expect Noor Aziz They see, but this contradiction will not appear is largely due to enable Mai Izz Al-Din, which has gained experience enough to have attracted to the grief of personal moments in its refractive, or what makes us laugh hard in moments of her emotions, without regard to the comparisons philosophical about the history of personal and Fair oz actions.
