Movie Name: Apocalypto Are you actually tell us about Mel Gibson's Mayan civilization and how over? Or shoot a man chosen flight of 6 armed men? I do not know exactly what you do here, Mel Gibson, the first buyers will expect to see the opening movie shows you one of the most important civilizations of the earth and how they ended greatness, so that the beginning of the film was more than excellent, but suddenly and without warning, Turns the movie to film the movement fast, chosen being around the jungle and behind 6 men dangerous insurgents want to kill him and he wants to be inflicted on his wife and child similarities wallow in the well, in fact I do not know why he was Jaqguar Jiabao selected originally, come baby alien infected with epidemic fatal casting on the edge of the road threatened Jaqguar chosen next! I do not understand why Gibson said he will appear to the people of the Mayan civilization, Mayan Where exactly! People and villagers, civil wars and religious rituals, all of which are present in many civilizations that have become extinct and Gibson did not put anything to distinguish the Maya never, I do not know you speak to the film script, frustrating? Or the end, ridiculous? But I will speak about the photography and sound effects, who surpassed the stage of artistic creativity, than Gibson himself in the movement of the camera and make it exciting all the time in addition to the use of make-up masterly fashion and wonderful, And do not forget the team up the good work that has changed much on the duration of filming and the use of people from the Mayan true to the film, in general the film is well excited, and only good, and fell scenario in many of the points overlooked by the author, but on the other hand, it has an excellent illustration of effects and more than deserved the wonderful film by 3 nominations at the Oscars Rating: 7 / 10
