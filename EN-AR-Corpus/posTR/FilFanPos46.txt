We identified the diver director Fakhruddin are good since the first collaboration with actress and singer preferred Amer penitent in the movie "Magic Eye". This time, I find in his new film "Diver" has provided a more sophisticated through the "frames" requested by the Director of Photography "diverse" Nizar Shaker, who always proves - it stresses - my theory that no matter what the cameraman was skillful and talented, the personal Unfortunately, the director must prevail against his will on film and determine the final level. Surely, there is a big difference between the image of Shaker in the film "diver" - despite the development of a "magic eye" - and "angel Alex" with Sandra grew up, and "Love" with Saad al-Hindawi, and certainly the movie "Boha" with Rami Imam, and if I saw this film certainly you will receive what is already indicated obvious differences as well as what refers to the talent of this photographer. Go back to the paint War level are good to find that in this movie already made an effort tangible to come out to work and clear and the sequence of "healthy" and the concept, and I consider this a way out well, and that there is a possibility to improve its performance as a director with both cinematic experience, but it must be pointed out that are good in my opinion is not of directors who have what we might call the "Powered By" Or in-depth theories of life, all these factors that we find the distinct directors and then by Youssef Chahine, Khairy Beshara and Yousry Nasrallah, but in the end the quality of the directors who can provide a film well and convincingly as possible, and this is not the little bit. The subject of the story itself by Abdel-Fattah Beltagui liked, we did not offer a while ago - and I'm talking For the Young Cinema - a film about a comment and Tot t father and mother ducks were most, and that the T Phil is an important member of the team this way, and Bt sell I compare the subject and not the idea of T Phil duck's, because Joseph mites Man in the "I love cinema" will be the winner in a comparison of this kind, but Omar Abdel-Hakim, the new face of T has the role of Phil "cream" Bkiva E fun and spontaneous, and if the exploitation of young talent this correctly - and I hope I see ads in tissue paper and then not on television - will make him not represented with great maturity. The problems of the film Vohddha in: "Altmt Yale" and "montage" and "sound engineering", for the represented Yale, spoke for T T Phil Omar, a talented, as I said earlier, and certainly "the Terrible" Hassan Hosni, who if you want to talk about it and crossed am impressed by his performance will not Ocfhih right, but the problems related to slowly for me the film core Amer penitent and Dalia Buhairi, where I found that they were both require a major effort to show that the performance and Altot t particularly in the scenes of crying that I find in my opinion the most important moments of Deuteronomy Bit "ingenuity" Almmt's size and its ability to Altot features seen his face, and this defect Bt sell it are good to blame himself because he did not "Enkc" within the LES represented enough to get the height of glamor. For Dalia specifically it saddens me with my cool performance here after that I saw and "very impressed" turn in "Harem cream" with director Ali Idris when embodied a housewife and mother "Kids" traditional, and I think she and Aamir was possible to get them on what is better than so. It should be noted Almmt Justice for Sami, who did not give us a role Mwt time ago i ra And night and was able this time to reprise the role of the husband loving understands to his wife's past the "king" and Oalaa on i, It may be her first husband is a wonderful and osmotic salute him hard, but the new face of Rania Heydar Syrian origin are certainly still need to be training courses stayed Fe in order to up their performance to Automatic stretch to LÃ¼bbe, as well as training to hide "Accent" Levantine whether to participate in the work of Egyptian drama. And editing, there are problems, "Low" I think that its presence offended Muinterp Maha Rushdie, especially with touches of montage "smooth" and comfortable in the whole work, and the work of the former and then for the "Night of the fall of Baghdad," with Mohammed Amin and "researcher s freedom" with Inas El and " Journey of Love "also, For Almt found the cat s" kit Anguish "is vague and sharp and then to" clip "successive which portrayed the life of the" age "and the" king "after separation, and there are cat e and one that appeared to show Hassan Hosni for the first time and appears to be on the activity thus creating the sea next to the scuba diving equipment and it seemed like talking to someone, w m e slice clamping suddenly appear Dalia is Mtot Rh and crying .. Etc., will not Oattab errors "Alrakor" - or configuration errors after you follow the viewer - because of world cinema itself of this defect. There are problems in the "Sound Engineering", for example in some scenes Amer, speaking in a low voice with his son in the film, and this affects the understanding of events, and that the provision of private persons and to clarify the events have been here through the general assessment: 3
