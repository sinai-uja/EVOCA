Name of the movie: Rendition Reyes and Ivbrson, Meryl Streep, Alan Larkin, Jake Jaylinhal, all these big names in the film talking about the American policy in the deportation of suspects to them in the issue of terrorism, and directed by Gavin Hood, at first glance seem it is a film-style monetary excellent , but this movie can be considered as a group of films that brings you many Stars, Without the level at all, as we saw the world the past with the Da Vinci Code, the story of the film talking about Anwar Brahimi Egyptian who now lives in America and married an American and has a child, is arrested by the U.S. government and be deported out of the country and tortured under the charge of suspicion in dealing with terrorists planned to blow up in Tunisia, well look a thorny issue and concern in the world, no doubt, but, What was discussed scenario? Nothing, scenario weak lacks professionalism in his work, ends and do not know what you what you may do author really about that case, the manipulation of events, torture and a few of the dialogue is what is making the scenario upon which the film, in a representation, it was interesting to see Merle Streep and Alan Larkin in some scenes trivial, but let us focus a little on the tournament, What do Jake in the film is one of the worst roles like in its history, bad for the degree of shame that this person had bet him in 2005 after his role great in Brokeback Mountain, I do not know what happened to him, perhaps personal and built two Alsiian, however, Jake was never sway me in any of the scenes portrayed, while in the other hand, Reyes made a role if we Jamlnaha him well, Cool in most cases, and in some good, Before I finish talking about representation in the film, will highlight the best representation of the performance in the film, and is Omar Metwally, who plays the role of the Patriarchs in the film and I do not know where to find these foreign producers of Arab representatives and how Ikchwounam, of Babel and United 93, to this film, the roles of Arab convincing and realistic, I do not know why this overlook the large by Arab producers in the discovery of talent, but insistent focus on the stars for the reputation and profit, return of the film before reading through the review of the pains of Arab cinema and poverty, music at work was the best Last therein, a mixture of Arabic music quiet and beautiful music with a modern flavor gave a wonderful and special to the viewer, And from here standing excellence in the film, not much.
