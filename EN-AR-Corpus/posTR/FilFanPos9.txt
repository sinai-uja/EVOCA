Without control after coming out of the display of the film and found myself busy with several questions, why resorted Ahmed Fahmy to enter the area did not get used to see inside, even in the songs display?, And Magdoy the presence of Maria in such a role, and what has prompted Ola Ghanem reprise the role of a girl aberrant, but One question Astvzni much I did not find the answer, how he sat 4 people to write the screenplay for this movie?! I will tell you the line and i petition to the story of the film to share my surprise, the film tells about a young man from the senior family loves a girl still in school, and wants to enter into a relationship with "because it is the same in one take him no," and another girl "atypical" proud Bcdhuzha, and the other did not Ios t her "people" i night events of the film, and two other young men from families of average e and a poor always soaked in addiction, all of whom are involved in something One, spend all night in an apartment, "177". Main characters of the film may vary in nature a bit, but they share one thing in common, addiction and sex, which Majolhm all look alike in their actions, even if not brought them together scenes and one, which gave the viewer a great sense of boredom to the similarity between most of the movie clips! Personal, embodied by Ahmed Fahmy has some swing, but it did not come out being a "virtual" only, where the young man sitting with his friends corrupt eat types of drugs, and can not find anything wrong to be recognized for Dolly Shaheen that he would not marry at all, is the same person who is " romantic "too with Maria, but he does not think in the end only one goal. I do not know why and agreed to accept my understanding then For this role which is the "shock" for him, is stretch the famous Lord five years ago did not see his video clip tacky, and has a cinematic experience and a single Astt Acts which reflect a young man, "elves" mixed with some comedy, and is attending to experience in front of Mona Zaki, Sharif Munir with thinner i-Arian, why pay to fall into this "quagmire" that did not add anything to him On the contrary, you may lose some of its audience. Personal Ola Ghanem do not need any explanation or interpretation, a girl abnormal exercise "lesbianism" with the girls Tstqt by her Marwa Abdel-Moneim, and convince these girls that "de not haram because they are girls costume some", and proud of i and the events of the film by recognizing as a girl abnormal, and Ola Ghanem, despite its existence for several years in the music scene but it did not Tstt p be the Butt Him for a good movie and then for most of her peers, so I would not say that the role of Ath t a negative, may have achieved what you want in this film, to join the list of artists who Kdmn the role of "girl Almt Les" in the Egyptian cinema! Dolly Shahin is still "reeling" in the cinema, which entered full force it will not get into one! It is clear that Dolly needs a lot of acting exercises that have not yet skillful, and that its tone should not appear in this format, as long as they have chosen to play the role of the Egyptian girl. Said Dolly Shaheen in one of the movie clips that her father "footmen on the ed case" and that "ready yet to be her father," and they do not like to stay long at home and prefers being in the apartment, "177", you forgot the director Hani Girgis Fawzi appear that the house even for a single shot ? I do not know you smile the face of the petition, which peaked after Maria out of the display of the film are courteous and satisfaction with the movie or what?, It fits such a role represented were classified as heroine of the film? The Nabil Issa, Randa Beheiri the bright side only the film, where he succeeded the first to reach the scenes of his presence and strong performance analog is good, although it is within the Clp "Apartment 177", but he was able to prove himself Ommam scenes, how to Randa Beheiri embodied the role of Hadi very The afternoon performance and impressions suitable for personal veiled girl embodied. May accuse the makers of the film critics that they do not tend to change and bold ideas have no desire, but regardless of my personal opinion in such thoughts, the movies made where such personalities and roles carried a lot of creativity representativeness and excretory and fiction, the qualities that have not seen any of which is "without censorship." With the absence of a good script, he could not heroes of the film show the potential may possess some of them, the absence of the heroes of the first row in the film turned elements of the representation of their own, leaving Ahmed Fahmi himself to the charm and humor, and resorted heroines of the film to the element of "femininity" which is not sufficient alone to make good actress. "Without censorship," it may be succeeded in the realization of the true meaning of collective Championship, but he proved that this kind of movies we can not yet well implemented with the exception of a few, and the idea of "sex addiction" should be controlled to such tests.
