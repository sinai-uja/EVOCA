Targeted in the first Valgram in spite of the large number of films Eid al-Fitr and the different types and forms and Atjhadtha, but it is difficult to hesitate before the film is written by the great writer Wahid Hamed. Vhamed addressed in targeted in the first Valgram the issue of ease of escape of the business out of Egypt, but Vajina this time his exit from fashionable in his writings and gave us a lighter work in the context of satire away when the traditional side that we are accustomed to see in the discussion of these issues both on the big screen or even the small screen . Perhaps the supervisor of the writings, Wahid Hamed will find that most of the films Avenue even though the comedies are usually discussed issues of bold is not exposed but Hamed such as The Yacoubian Building and the Minister and sleep in honey, terrorism, kebabs and other movies that did not come without controversy after its presentation, but it seems that Hamid wanted to be light viewers "cakes and biscuits," this year. And attract my attention from the film at first glance through the wonderful introduction, which was work of animation in line with the general framework of the film, to give an atmosphere of fun, feel the scenes after the end of the show that eating a light healthy meal, including all the important nutrients. And that provided the viewer has been prepared psychologically to see the lighter work, and increased the soundtrack of talented Tamer Crown, who confirmed to me his talent after hearing the soundtrack for the movie "Real Dreams", it is very important that all the tools of artistic work going in one direction, and this Valmalsq publicity for the film was that the film shows a light shade. The director Hafiz Muhammad Ali not to depart from the framework light of the film, was to design the Tatars with the soundtrack and bright colors propaganda poster, and then pause Menna Shalabi, suggesting that the recklessness, the largest impact on the lack of research on the dramatic details of the complex. Not only the quality of the soundtrack on the front of the film but rather extended to the rest of the watch was appropriate and consistent with a viewer does not feel homosexuality or stay away from the atmosphere of the music of the film. As for the selection of heroes was appropriate for the characters, Vhanni safety persuaded the audience to perform the role of the young rich playboy, which depends on the name of his family all the time even in the most crises, I do not think that the safety of any difficulty in the performance of personal Amr Sioufi for ease of writing on paper and is free of details dramas difficult You may need to double effort. Let me speak For Menna Shalabi and the role of Miss Sondos, it is entirely new to him and different from what made before, and it was clear that it examined the personal in all its dimensions well, plus it added by some of the comedy Duck leaflet she fast and clothes, was the girls "Allboukh" polite romance , and that when she wanted to hide so you do not know the condition E Her appearance became a girl full of Balonot H. I think of it is now able to engage in adults, has reached a degree of technical maturity and awareness that qualifies them to embody any character brought before it. Have led the new face of Dora role "Neisse" popular girl full of fine feminine role, but have not had the opportunity to highlight the artistic talent is great, this is what I mentioned before that the film is devoid of details difficult drama. The saliva of some of the attendees some tips for the film that may offend modesty and specifically in the way of punishment, "Maulana", a role played by the artist Qadeer Ahmed's salary, which it adopted on that box of sex work, but I do not see that he has exaggerated it was intended to discipline Sioufi more than just a hint of indecent assault.
