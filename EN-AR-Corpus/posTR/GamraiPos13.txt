13 - Movie Name: The Barber Of Siberia Rating: 8 / 10 I feel great joy when I watch when I do not expect a lot from him, and the like, it seems that this week I had an appointment with a number of these films, Not my son has a lot of hopes, but have proved to the contrary, and Barber Siberia, the most important, is the first film which was seeing the director known Russian Nikita Makulov, which is one of the directors, the Russians, who pumped in his films budgets enormous, arrived most recently for $ 50 million ,, with the support of Russian Prime Minister, this movie, was not abnormal for others, not a luxury potential directorial giant, And productivity of an impressive, accompanied by potential technical and not insubstantial, and, more importantly, professional directorial and the strength of his performance of Nikita Makulov and her representative established the wonderful Julia Ormond, but nevertheless, the film disappointing, because I felt as if he passed on this film Mkrjan, and clerks, director and writer do well the first part of it throughout the hour and a half, and the director and writer do well last time and the other half of it, It seemed the movie boot is weak, and the way a cynical and unconvincing in the sequence of events and related accessories, in addition to the style of comedy seemed to me an outsider with watching an hour and a half the other bearing the dimension of tragedy, political, symbolic and clear missed and a half hours the first two parts were linked, significantly, but addressed a different way, The method used to Nikita to criticize the policy of the Russian military at the end of the eighteenth century, the century that promised Russia the whole world, artists Ross novelists and writers of the highest level seen for the day to celebrate the world with them, and influenced by everyone interested in art and artists, including a step in the period of the hardest periods Russian history, and most unjustly, the name of Tolstoy's hero, It is not relevant about the writer and novelist famous Tolstoy writer legend novelist Anna Karenina, but naming the hero of this label were not a coincidence, the director wants to loose the link even symbolically between the creators of that period, the time in Russian history, and political power The military junta, which tarnished the reputation of the great Russian technicians one way or another, Which forms Nikita is naive childish, and stupid, to the point reached by it, because depicting Czar children do not exceed a few years, the film talks about the woman an American, came to Russia, the country's mysterious, seeming confused between customs established the Automatic, and between the Russians and the habits of this huge country puzzling, how to think the Russians and how they plan to perform their duties, how to love, how to fight, And how to surrender, seemed to have a Russian map difficult to read, the American who came to Russia to launch a project Barber of Siberia, Partition trees, to witness the novel The Barber of Siberia, Tolstoy, a young Russian who is concepts, and gave it back to life and love, and flag How can a mother that is harsh on the young, and beheading them without pity, in Russia, a country that taught the world what is the meaning of political loyalty, And subordination of military, it is clear from this film, that Nikita man difficult to understand the smooth, man, elusive, is able to send you to the maze of intellectual history, and is capable of that genuinely interests Bsinmah, and is able to correct the mistakes of his films, and is capable of to say what he wants to say, boldly, in the face of his opponents, perhaps even without the need to understand it, I saw the film, In my mind much of what I can to translate the joints of the events of the movie and the projections, but at the same time I feel that what I missed from the ideas of the film is equal to what has taken him, despite its simplicity, absolute, and Slasth, not for the hour and a half the first in my opinion did not serve part film II only fraction, although it as the first part, the comedy, which were included, despite being surplus to the need for the film, it's not delicious, Did not feel well in the film, for otherwise, to take the film full tag, but enough that this film left me longing to see the other films of Nikita Makulov.
