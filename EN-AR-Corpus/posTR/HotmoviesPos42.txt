The Wrestler wrote: Mohammed al-Masri Rating: 5 out of 5 Starring: Mickey Rourke, Marisa Tomei, Evan Rachel Wood Directed by: Darren Ornowski And now, I'm an old broken down piece of meat .. and I'm alone. And I deserve to be all alone, O God, on this movie! , Every time I've seen this masterpiece Ornowski remember Elia Kazan and Terry Malloy their scene is great for those who wanted to become (something), in the Mrt Would that recent deals with "Darren Ornowski" stage of the demise of wrestler Randy Robinson, after twenty years from that moment it took to reach the summit of his glory, the film starts with a smart editorial summarizes all the glory of the past, ducks and Lth exclusively w m shocking - with the end of Alttrut - cough Duck And the angle of his camera low - and very expressive - to make it at the end of staff alone, and since the beginning Ornowski fills his film seen and Et, Noor Aziz, seen from the blues .. That kind of grief and almost Nchaara Ntelmush even if not on the surface .. The sadness inherent in the unit ducks Him and the small details of his life and his attempt to overcome or reconcile with her no matter how harsh, and with a heart attack after the game is very violent movie starts Mnatt P importantly in trying to find another opportunity - perhaps the last as well - some (meaningless) to real life for i Saliva left by his relationship with his daughter and a small strip dancer that collected by the love / attention from the very special kind, but what used to be lived for him was greater than that extend past the new, uh, in its infancy .. Firtkp same Alokt constructive committed in the past and return to the place only when the contents of the world did not care about him, Darren Ornowski offers the best of his films here, in my view, faq T mature and honest Bkt see what it was before, depending on the details and performance data and Mat e affecting the heart faq t from its reliance on "Style Optical", you feel close to duck him and sensor for the nation to the degree to which force you in every moment on the Altat P with him in spite of all Alokt termination committed by and still, it helped him to a very wonderful Odaiin of Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood, and the performance Another "great" - and nothing less than that - from Mickey Rourke, Mickey Rourke is the spirit of this work .. Give him all the sincerity and Cjnh and shipped At faithful through the moments and scenes will not be forgotten, carries the pain of years and a weakening of the body on his shoulders and reflects Et seen from the rear all the pain of personal appearances-day search of the (value) is missing and (with) did not find itself only among the cries of spectators, is the best performance Non-winner of an Oscar in the new millennium for me and within Svutea in general, and will probably remain the imagination of the time i Will linking between profiles "Rourke", his voice hoarse and his sad and everything to do with loneliness and cruelty of reality and the demise of stardom and the last opportunities to miss it is lost then everything ..
