 7 - the name of the movie: Lemony Snicket's, A Series of Unfortunate Events Rating: 9 / 10 The story revolves around the evil man Olaf, who tries to take on the legacy of three young relatives and that after the death of their parents in an unfortunate accident, and he is custody. Personally categorize the film of black comedy where the laughs on the performance of Carey and burning at the same time your heart went out to the children. Featured Movie in all aspects of representation and a good performance in terms of Jim Carrey and his fellow bad guys (with a touch of comedy) or the three children who have mastered their roles in Adaa well. The sequence of events was also entertaining and fun of the misery and sorrow of the death of parents - the transition to life with Uncle Punk - Enormous difficulties that occur with it - trying to kill them more than once - they discover many of the unfortunate facts with good end of the film.
