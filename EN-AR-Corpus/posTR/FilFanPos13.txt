Civic Duty What happens if you paste your face in the picture so big? Will be all you see is a point contiguous you do not have a clear picture, and this is the closest thing happened to the American people or the young man, "Allen" in the film as he looks to Arab and Muslim world through the whole unit small represented in the "Gabe Hassan," a neighbor of the New Arab. This is revealed to us the young director Jeff Rinfor, as he approached the camera director of photography creative Dillen Macleod of television, the hero's first film, "a national duty," which are accompanied by squares consisting of the big picture most of the film, and with it the voice of commentator Bulletin speaks of "rising prices, redundancies , recession, financial market .. And the names of some Arabs and Muslims, most wanted to justice. "These are the factors Almwt Consequences on the lives of Allen, who know with the first moments of the film his music soundtracks quiet loss of function, to follow the first quarter of the film - Canadian American - rhythm is monotonous, unites us with the main character of the film, and every now and then breaking director boredom leaked to the viewer through one of the surprises the new, then we define the lives of Allen's marriage, or the new neighbor. The scenario Mahbuka professionalism when you enter a new neighbor to the world of Allen, the most important feature knitting Rinfor the character of Hassan made by Khaled Abol Naga is our definition of this character through the view of Allen, we see in the middle of the first movie good through the window of his home in small, or behind the curtains and the house of the yen, which has become trapped him and his concern about the new neighbor. Characterized by the camera to move about between the monitoring of the world about Allen, including the good, in monitoring the Allen himself loses his cool gradually, and rushes into the injustice of good governance advance it, to start the rhythm of the film to rise gradually, filed the case of inaction that accompanied the start, especially with the inventory of events is between the duo Allen and good, and an agent of U.S. Central Intelligence Hillary watch them. With a focus on personal good, we begin to viewers Egyptians to identify the functional possibilities which is characterized by Abu al-Naja, who managed in spite of the fact that his character provided by the effect of, rather than effective in attracting the attention of the viewer, especially with autism in tension, which placed him together with Allen. And helped Abu Naga in drilling personality and in the minds of viewers state of apprehension that was it, and the fine details of small, which gave us the director to open the door to a background graphic of good historical, his sweetheart in the image of Paris, his work in the shop the Arab, his study of chemical and concern of the eyes control him through the window . The film has a lot of events, which amounted to the thrill of escalated with the breath of the audience in the hall, however, number of principal players who appeared in the film were five, and most of the events of the film took place in the building, which includes my home and Allen Hassan. And combined several factors to push the breath of the pursuing of excitement, the first enable representatives Abul-Naga and Peter Krause in providing state of terror that Ashaha, then sympathy hidden between them, then challenge in the last conversation that took place between them after stormed the Allen house good gun, and bound him with ropes to put him in a trial judge and the prosecution where is Allen. The second of these factors is the soundtrack and editing the footage seamlessly link between rhythm and earn a speed suitable for the position, and the music was reflected in the high words of Hassan Allen and angry, and silent in the moments of silence over the edge of the viewer. But it might be the camera angles are the ducks for bakacad bakacad who attended the two stars Hawwarihama, Validhae E was excellent, especially in the enclosure in an apartment in good, and the movements of the camera lens very new, and the method to focus on a particular part of the face and leave the rest of the face, angles and clamping s, were all elements added to the scene of well-deserved, and made the boredom seep away from the room, which included two individuals for the i and the night of the film. And this is a T end of the film is very strong, both Occurrence of wife Allen a victim of fear excessive and unjust to others, in the code to the victims of the American political system, or to enter the Allen clinic mental health as a symbol of the madness of the current government, or eventually open that have not acquits good final with hearing the news of the death Omriken due to chemical compounds and then for which he worked the good, to keep everyone in check innocent and a terrorist. "National duty" Film is very important, for the viewer the U.S. and Western who does not know about the other side of the truth but something to offer television channels, which sees us as Arabs and Muslims from the narrow window such as window Allen, and important for the scenes of the Egyptian and Arab to know the influences that distort its image abroad <evaluation General: 4
